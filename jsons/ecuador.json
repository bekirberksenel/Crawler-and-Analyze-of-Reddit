                    "Dear community,",
                    "I am travelling to Quito on 21th of July and will spend 3 weeks in Ecuador. I have read about a festival to celebrate the founding of Guayaquil around July 25th but couldn't find any details online. The 24th also seems to be a holiday (birthday of Simon bolivar).",
                    "Is it worth it to head towards Guayaquil shortly after my arrival in Quito to partake in the festivities? Are there interesting rituals, traditional danced and music? Where in this big city are they located at? Is it safe? I'm not sure how big a role this should play in my travel plans.",
                    "If any of you know what to expect there please let me know. Thank you very much in advance.",
                    "Hey OP, Guayaquilean here. There are a number of music festivals, food markets and parades around the city during that week. I would suggest to come and check the city out for 2 - 3 days for the festivities. After that, you can go to the beach or go back to highlands as you prefer.",
                    "Now, is it safe? A highlander would say \"Yes\", someone from the coast \"Sort of\", anyone else \"Just don't act recklessly and you'll be fine\" Don't let this question stop you from exploring the country.",
                    "Enjoy your travels!",
                    "so, gye-rian here",
                    "you have to search by \"fiestas julianas, patronales guayaquil \"and there is a lot of info, sandly mostly in spanish",
                    "http://www.guayaquilesmidestino.com/en/content/saint-festivities-guayaquil",
                    "thats on english",
                    "maybe DM me before that day and we will see if we can hang out",
                    "cheers",
                    "Not sure how many festivals are there, but the beach is relatively close. Just remember that this is a big city, with more than 3 million inhabitants, so when in big events, take good care of your belongings. It will always be better to have a tour with a local, specially to prevent you from bumping into dangerous places imo.",
                    "There are good tourist places here: Seminario Park (Iguana park), Puerto Santa Ana, Cerro Santa Ana, Malecón, Parque Histórico Zoo, Santay Island, among others.",
                    "Finally, you can hang with expat groups or people that can show you the surroundings with a local perspective. Actually I'm part of a group of regular people that meet up to practice English, so I'm sure that more than one will happily show you around. I believe that the best part of Guayaquil and the coast is its cuisine. Totally worth the trip, I promise.",
                    "Tooootally worth it!! Come and enjoy a true tropical weather, great seafood and nice places to see, plus you are 1 hour away from the beach...I would say that every day Guayaquil becomes more a must when visiting Ecuador..."

OP, you should look at the consulate website for specific requirement details, but basically you will need to fill out the paperwork, pay the fees, request an appointment, and then present yourself for an in person interview. You want to prove to the best of your ability that you have strong ties to Ecuador and fully intend to return. There's still no guarantee you'll get the visa but that's where you'd start. Good luck!",

It sucks they didn't stand up to it, but they can't risk losing market share as a lot of Ecuadorian farmers depend on US consumers.

My previous trips had me taking the Delta flight to Quito and I would take a bus from Carcelen the following day/night. Next month I will be flying Spirit to Guayaquil and landing at 10:30pm. I know the bus terminal is very close to the airport so I could probably be at the terminal at 12:00am. Are there any buses or busettas that leave for Cuenca at or around that time?",

I recommend you take a cab to their station as it may be dangerous for you to walk with baggage at that hour, or as suggested, stay at the Holiday Inn and walk on the next with daylight.  I’ll pm a pic of the phone numbers.  Good luck!!",

                    "So my younger brother is getting married to an Ecuadorian girl, they're having the (1st) wedding in Quito and I've officially been asked to be the best man (there will be a second but smaller wedding in the states at some point). I've never been so my knowledge of the culture is limited. I've also never been best man before but am mostly familiar with the role in a typical American wedding. What should I know about Ecuadorian culture and how it relates to weddings specifically to help prepare for this? As of now my only known responsibilities are:",
                    "- Maybe plan a bachelor party? We are spending a week in the amazon prior to the wedding week just the two of us and our youngest brother, so that will fill part of the pre-wedding celebrations roll. After talking with the groom he's not requiring an actual bachelor party night out but is open to ideas so at this point its just a maybe. I feel like this is typically the main responsibility of a best man but I have no need to push for it if it doesn't fit with the vibe of the wedding, tradition, schedule etc. Are similar bachelor parties normal in Ecuador?",
                    "- Give a toast/speech. I was already planning on this whether I was best man or not given I am the older brother. I plan on writing a speech in both English and Spanish for the bride's family. I know the bride's family are very traditional but my brother and the bride definitely are not. Any tips on giving a speech in Spanish to a bunch of Ecuadorians? Also my Spanish is very limited but I have two months to freshen up on it and get a speech written.",
                    "-General damage control/main man/fixer of all problems.",
                    "About the Bride/Groom: I believe she works as a gallery curator and runs some children's programs for/with a museum or something along those lines. He is a freelance investigative journalist. Both are very modern hip intellectuals but down to earth. Both our families our well travelled and culturally experienced if this means anything at all. He's 29 and she's 33 I think.",
                    "Info on the wedding: They are not having a huge traditional wedding. He said the ceremony will be standing room only and last about ten minutes, followed by dinner, reception (toasts) , then lots of whiskey drinking and shenanigans. There will be a dj/mc then a banda de pueblo to close the night. I think it will be 100 people max. He hasn't disclosed the location to me or my family as he wants it to be a surprise for our family. This doesn't help lol.",
                    "Any tips or general advice is much appreciated!",
                    "I'm from Guayaquil, the coast, which has some differences with Quito (the highlands). However, I may give you some advice.",
                    "Ecuadorian culture is usually conservative and formal. They like being part of the norm, specially regarding about weddings.",
                    "From what I understand, this won't have a religious ceremony, so in that sense it will be more relaxed. Ecuadorian weddings usually start relaxed and fancy, really polite and as always the newlyweds are the center of the attention.",
                    "We do have best man here, but their role is less significant as in American culture. Usually they don't give speeches, instead it is given by one or both of the newlyweds' fathers (not parents, fathers). So the best man role is generally to plan a bachelor party for the groom and some of his male friends and relatives, and even maybe to some of the bride's male friends or relatives. The latter is up to a previous agreement with the groom and the bride, so I suggest you to talk to them both about this.",
                    "Since the party will take place in the highlands (Quito or its surroundings), it will most likely be located outdoors, and the time of the wedding will probably at noon so it won't be as chilly as in nightime. For the most part, it is as any Latin party, after the relaxed part and the food service, it is loud and fun. You'll see lots of booze, specially hard liquor, lots of dancing, so I'll bet you have a blast.",
                    "Finally, I can tell you that us Ecuadorians are really warm and kind people. You'll make lots of new friends here. I hope that I helped you and that you have an awesome time here!",
                    "Thanks for the reply! Definitely excited about it and I’m sure it will be an awesome time. He asked me to make a short toast so I’ll just do something short and sweet.",
                    "All I can say is get ready for some serious drinking.",
                    "Only worthy advice right there!!",
                    "they are quite fancy and usually very sexual",
                    "Well that’s good news!",
                    "In the end, everybody gets drunk af. Just enjoy.",
                    "I think bachelor parties are the same in Ecuador as in the rest of the world. Quito is slightly more liberal than Guayaquil so I guess you could have fun. On the matter of the toast, I think both families are liberal which is good. Usually toasts here involve religion, god, have family and that stuff. Just go for it.",
                    "It would really help a lot to know the location. It might give you a better insight on how's the wedding's going to be.",
                    "Congratulations  on your little brother and may they live happy.",

                    "So my cousin got of a bus and was set upon by 3 muggers - one with a knife. My cousin managed to hit the guy with the knife resulting in the guy falling to ground and hitting his head (out cold). One mugger ran away and my cousin apprehended the third mugger.  Police came and saw my cousin fighting with the one he apprehended and initially thought my cousin was the instigator so they cuffed him . Witnesses then came forward and explained what occurred and my cousin was set free. The guy he hit was taken to hospital and the one he apprehended was arrested. What has me worried is my cousin was told by police “you’re lucky he didn’t die”.   We’re worried now as why would they say this? Three guys - one armed attacker’s my cousin and he acted in self defence. Why would the police make this comment ? The police asked him to come back to the police station to make a formal statement and now we haven’t heard from him in 3 hours and we’re really worried.  What should we do ? My cousin is not an Ecuadorian national and lives there on a visa .",
                    "Update: all is ok. He’s home now. So my geography is somewhat out - it happened in  somewhere in Santa Elena.  When he went back to police station they took the 3 muggers (injured guy was ok and patched up), my cousin and a lawyer to Guayaquil. Apparently that’s like 2 -3 hrs drive?  There was some brief appearance (court?) of some kind and my cousin was free to go.  He has no cell/mobile phone to keep in touch which is what I’ll be getting him for Christmas I think . Apparently taken to Guayaquil for crime statistic reasons ? A foreigner getting mugged in a tourist town in Santa Elena is bad press? Anyway, Thankyou all for your help, suggestions and comments .  Cheers",
                    "Nah... but just have a lawyer with you and talk to the embassy as well. Just like in every other country know your rights and you will never be prosecuted for this, the police hate muggers as much as you do. With the proper company Go to the police so they actually get those guys prosecuted otherwise you’ll let them go out and do this to other people, which is what happens often because people don’t make the formal declarations.",
                    "Thanks for quick reply .  He’s already gone to police station but without lawyer and hasn’t contacted embassy .... he “trusts the system “ he said. But I’m worried because it’s been so long and we haven’t heard back from him .  Cheers",
                    "3 hours is nothing in Ecuador. Everything beurocratic takes forever. Probably still waiting his turn.",
                    "Well that’s what I’m hoping . Cheers",
                    "Police get those guys prosecuted? Have you even been to Ecuador? There is no criminal offense and thus no prosecution unless you had to take days off work due to injury and have a legal medical certificate to show it.",
                    "Is he white?",
                    "Nope. Will that matter much ?",

                    "can i ask where this happened and at what time?",
                    "Like 8:30 in the morning I believe",
                    "which bus route was he on?",

Just like in every other country know your rights and you will never be prosecuted for this, the police hate muggers as much as you do. With the proper company Go to the police so they actually get those guys prosecuted otherwise you’ll let them go out and do this to other people, which is what happens often because people don’t make the formal declarations.",

We're traveling to Ecuador in a couple of weeks, mostly to visit family, but want to get a taste of the chocolate industry while we're there. Does anyone have any recommendations for a chocolate factory tour/tasting experience? I'm hoping to find something that's not geared only towards tourists, because our group will be Ecuadorian (except for me). We'll be traveling from Quito, so something within that area would be best.Gracias por su consejo!",

I Just meant that we would be starting from Quito rather than, say, Quayaquil, so places that are within a day trip from Quito would be ideal.",

Hopefully one day governments will make the cities more livable and we will only have the iconic ones left in the city cores (e.g Quicentro, El Jardín, and Mall del Sol & San Marino in Guayaquil).  As for the more suburban areas like Cumbaya or Samborondon, hopefully we revitalize those sectors to be more inclusive and less highwayish.",

                    "And as the mall being core outlets, I think another factor is that people who take the bus or aren't able to travel far, end up going to the nearest mall in Quito (say if you live in Carcelen, then you'd be able to afford a bus or a cab to Condado Shopping; As it's much cheaper than taking a Taxi from Carcelen to Quicentro Sur), and it depends if you live in different sectors at Quito.

                    "I have a few questions - It's been a few years since I've been back to the pachamama. In 2011 I had the amazing experience of going to the Galapagos Island. I was in my teens and my mom paid for the trip. We purchased the tickets in a travel agency in Guayaquil and we stayed on a yatch sorta thing for 3 nights.",
                    "I want to go back and my gringo husband is coming with me. We are thinking of going in early November of this year. Is it more economical to purchase the tickets to Galapagos in Ecuador? Would we be able to find somewhere to stay with that short of a notice? We are planning on going for 10 days. My husband, along with his family (6 in total) are planning on going. Is it realistic to expect that we can find somewhere to go in Galapagos for 6 people, in that short of notice? Does anyone have any idea what the prices will be? We are thinking of going for 3-4 days. Apologies for the loads of questions! Thanks in advance for your help!",
                    "I think I payed $300 from Guayaquil. We stayed at a super cheap place.  Even if you pay too much it is still a good trip. It's a once in a lifetime kinda place.",
                    "Did that include lodging? Or was that just the flight to the Galapagos?",
                    "Just keep in mind that between Nov 1-4, it's a holiday here in Ecuador. So hotels and airplanes should me more packed.",
                    "You said that when you went there years ago, you stayed on a yatch. Do you plan to do something like that this time, or just book a hotel? It's an order of magnitude cheaper if you go to a hotel instead of staying on a yatch. It's even cheaper if you reserve/rent the hotel yourself instead of using a travel agency.",
                    "I visited Galapagos around 10 years ago, but I don't think things should have changed much. Even more, I think maybe they have changed but for the better, I see there are lots of affordable offerings in AirBNB. Just book in advance, and enjoy!",
                    "Regarding tickets, you could just use the local airlines' websites: Tame, Lan, Aerogal. Good luck! Let me know if you have any doubt.",
                    "I’m thinking this time around we are considering Airbnb’s. The boat isn’t in our budget :(",
                    "Meh, the boat is overkill. Also you can always take a boat and visit the shores and beaches, there are a lot of \"tours\", it's way cheaper if you book them by yourself at the malecón (though be aware that they may overcharge gringo looking people, try to join a local group of people also willing to take the tour, and settle for a shared group price)",
                    "I was born in Ecuador and moved to the states at 6yrs old. In my blood to haggle! Hahaha! I’m definitely going to try and get those prices lowered! Hahaha",
                    "You should be able to get lodging and tickets without hassle in November.",
                    "Should be easy to get tickets, you can probably find tickets between $300-$400 I just booked tickets for July that cost me around $320. I'm planning on visiting the islands in a ''budget'' way, so without cruise. Don't think accommodation will be a problem in November.",
                    "That’s what we are planning on doing it, i wasn’t sure if there was a “budget” options!",
                    "I'll let you know how it went, I will go first week of July.",
                    "Yes please! I would love to see pictures! Hope you have an amazing trip!",
                    "Sure thing, will send you some tips/recommendations! Thank you!",
                    "I think you can find somewhere but it will a bit more expensive than the off season prices because of the holidays. Looking something for November is not short notice imo. I went a couple of years ago and iirc a nice hostel was about $20 per person for the day. There were not many Airbnb options back then, I would recommend looking for hostels.",
                    "Tickets could be around $400-$500 or more because of the season.",
                    "We are planning on going for 10 days. My husband, along with his family (6 in total) are planning on going. Is it realistic to expect that we can find somewhere to go in Galapagos for 6 people, in that short of notice? Does anyone have any idea what the prices will be? We are thinking of going for 3-4 days.",
                    "Are you planning on 10 days in the Galapagos or 3-4 days?  Personally I'd say spend as much time on the islands as possible.  If you're looking for some insight on Galapagos cruises this guy did a good write up on the process.  The only concern I'd have is if you're looking for 6 last minute open spots.  You will be going during down season though.  Somewhere to stay on the islands won't be difficult.  When I landed there a couple of years ago I didn't have a room booked and plenty of places were readily available.  Even if you don't do a cruise, you can island hop, do day tours and bike around with your snorkel gear.  If a beach looks tempting you can head out and explore.  I'd recommend spending a few days on Isabella.  I'm headed back in two weeks myself, so if you have any questions I'd be happy to help."

A con of this is that it can get a bit expensive but if you save during the rest of trip you can maybe go there for a weekend. I think this is the best way to be immersed in the jungle: you will spot wild life, eat traditional food, go around with native guides and something I'm really looking for is the view of the night sky from the middle of nowhere.",

It's run by a veterinarian who rehabilitates wounded jungle animals or exotic pets to go back to where they belong. We were the only guests there when we went and the person who showed us around was incredibly knowledgeable about the local wildlife. We learned a lot of great stuff. Hopefully it's still the same - this was probably 8 years ago.",

Good music, food and entertainment...I love the 'toros' that they do, as well as the parade. Lovely little town!",

Bur regarding your question, Iphones are quite expensive and well priced here, specially if being on a good state. For a 5s you could easily sell it for more than 300.. more if it were new. For a 7 you could get more than 500.",

Bur regarding your question, Iphones are quite expensive and well priced here, specially if being on a good state. For a 5s you could easily sell it for more than 300.. more if it were new. For a 7 you could get more than 500.",

                    "Hello,",
                    "American looking for Spanish language school recommendations preferably in Quito but open to any city. I'm arriving in Quito in  July and would like to take 20hrs of private lessons a week for 2 months and would like to arrange for a homestay with wifi for the first month.  The schools I've found in Quito are all over $9hr for private lessons. If anyone can provide recommendations that would be excellent.",
                    "Thank you.",
                    "Hi Will, I'm currently in Quito and have followed spanish lessons for the past 2/3 months at BananaSpanish. They are located on walking distance of Plaza Foch and are absolutely amazing. I'm pretty sure that they can help you with finding a home-stay and believe they even offer it themselves. Prices for private lessons are $7,50 an hour. Check here for more information http://bananaspanish.com/wp/ or send me a PM and I'll bring you in contact with my teacher :)",
                    "Sent you a PM",
                    "Hi, I'm an Australian who lives in Galapagos and before I arrived to Ecuador 3 years ago had no Spanish language skills at all. I studied at Simon Bolivar Spanish School in Cuenca for approximately 2 weeks and it was great. I believe they also have a location in Quito. When I had to return to Australia for 6 months I continued classes with them with a teacher through Skype and it was great. Approximately $10 per hour from memory.",
                    "Yeah, my Exchange mom came to Cuenca and she went to many Spanish schools in Cuenca downtown, her Spanish improved a lot more than I expected.",
                    "Check out University of Cuenca it's in the southern part of Ecuador. A lot of Americans go there to learn Spanish.",
                    "I'm Quito now. I've been taking private lessons for the past three weeks, and I have five more weeks to go. I do six hours a day, but I think that four hours a day would be just as fine.",
                    "The name of the school is \"Ailola Quito\", located in the the old town (near the corner of Galapagos and Oriente). What I like about them is that they provide their own curriculum (meaning that they wrote their books and know how to teach them), and are very accommodating to everything I needed (free pick up at airport, a family to stay with, etc).",
                    "In other words, they seem to be professionals who know what they are doing. The flip side to that is that they are professionals who are running a business, and sometimes it shows. But I doubt that changes from language school to language school.",
                    "Edit: I also want to say that my homestay has free, somewhat fast, but reliable wifi."

                    "I’m flying into Quito around 7pm and leave next day at 1:30pm. Should I make the drive to the historic district or is there somewhere closer to the airport I can check out?",
                    "I have time to check out the historic district on the back end of my trip so wondering if there is somewhere closer I can stay to the airport for convenience.",
                    "If you have a vehicle, check out http://www.termaspapallacta.com/?lang=en With you own vehicle or taxi, it would take about 45 min from the airport hotel to get there. If you can leave early in the morning, say 5:30am and be back by 10am. They open really early. You can even go there at night and book your hotel room with them. The place is very nice.",
                    "I would totally second the suggestion of Papallacta, if you are going to be able to see Quito on the way back (from Galapagos, I assume - at least many itineraries work this way). If you aren't worried about price, get a taxi straight there from the airport and stay in the cabañas with access to private hot spring pools. In the morning you could head for the airport around 10am and make your flight. The other option is to look for a place to stay near the airport. There are several upscale places and an increasing number of Arbnb, hostels, places listed on booking.com, and so on. With transport and everything you really don't have much time. Enjoy!",
                    "Yes going to see Quito on the way back so may try and see Papallacta then. Decided we wanted to be rested for the rest of the trip so going to stay close to the airport! Thanks!",
                    "The historic centre of Quito is actually pretty far from the airport. You mentioned driving so I'm guessing you have a car, in which case that will be faster than getting the bus in, but at that time of night I'm still not sure it'd really be worth it. Unless you have energy after your flight to go out at all, I imagine you'll arrive at a hotel and just want to relax/sleep...in which case you'd probably be better off just staying in Pifo or Tababela.",
                    "This is what we ended up deciding to do thank you! Don’t want to start off the trip tired :)",
                    "There’s a hotel at the airport now. I’m pretty sure it’s open. I would just stay there. I mean you can try to do something in the historic district but you won’t get out to your hotel until at least 9pm and then after checking in and getting settled it’d be even later. I would say do it if you weren’t coming back to Quito, but I’m not sure it’s worth it after a long flight.",
                    "Still depends on how energetic you are. If you can handle ~6h sleep after a long flight go for it, wake up early and take a walk before going to the airport in the morning. I would only do this on a Friday or Saturday. I don’t know how populated it is at night during the week.",

                    "Moving to Quito in August and after 4 years struggling to find clothes that fit me in Asia, I'm wondering about availability of good quality clothes in larger sizes (16+) for women, especially after finding out about the strict import rules for used clothing.",
                    "I can tell you shoes will be tough if you have larger sizes. I wear a women's 10 and had to scour stores throughout Guayaquil to ever find anything, because looking in the coastal town where I lived was just pointless. It was usually easier to just buy shoes while I was out of country and bring them back. The only thing I could find relatively easily were flip flops.",
                    "I never had an issue with clothing but I'm a 12 at most and a M - L in shirts so your experience might be different depending on what you're looking for. What I can tell you is that getting your clothes tailored is very affordable (compared to, say, American prices) and sometimes if I couldn't find what I was looking for I'd just get it made from scratch. That obviously might not be an option for your whole wardrobe but if you find a good tailor/seamstress it could be a nice backup option.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "Yes, my mother-in-law has her clothes made from scratch every couple of years.",
                    "Yep, you’re gonna have a bad time if you are expecting for any store here to have large clothing. It makes no sense for stores here to try and import clothes no one will buy since there is rarely anyone that large here. You might as well buy the materials yourself and have it custom made like others have said.",
                    "Good to know. Thank you",

I wear a women's 10 and had to scour stores throughout Guayaquil to ever find anything, because looking in the coastal town where I lived was just pointless. It was usually easier to just buy shoes while I was out of country and bring them back. The only thing I could find relatively easily were flip flops.",

A spectacular view well worth the 450+ steps. You can stop many times as you climb these steps and enjoy a beer at one of the small bars. The city itself is very safe, I have found the people helpful and friendly as my Spanish is very weak.",

                    "If you're renting a car,  try going to Playa Rosada and Los Frailes  (these are a bit difficult/complicated to access if you don't have a car), other great options are Puerto  Lopez and  San Clemente. I  love all of these beaches! Guayaquil is OK, (I'm from there), it's true that people love to hate it, like someone else commented, but it's for a reason, so please be careful. Just avoid exposing your stuff unless it's necessary. Also, be extra careful if you'll move around in public transportation, specially if it's crowded. Tbh, I'd suggest using Uber or Cabify if you won't rent a car, actually, I'd rather go to the beach than stay here, lol. Btw, if you go to Los Frailes, go early enough and  bring lots of sunscreen, it closes at 5 pm iirc (it's a protected area, so they don't allow access after that time), and you don't have anything to cover from the sun while in there, however, the place is really beautiful. Well, I hope this helps you! Have a safe trip and enjoy this tiny beautiful country! :)",
                    "Edit: I forgot to tell you how long to stay, haha. So, the car is what  may determine this. For instance, last year my bff came from Argentina for the first time and we went first to Salinas, then came back to Guayaquil on the same day. Then we went to Playa Rosada early in the morning and then we went in the afternoon to Montañita, we stayed in a hotel there, but the  next  day we went to Los Frailes and returned to Montañita for the evening. Tbh, I don't like the beach itself in Montañita, you'd probably love it if you surf. Anyway, that's two nights staying there, and it was perfect bc the hotel had a pool, so, that was fun. Then we went to Puerto Lopez early and since it was my birthday, we went to spend the night with my brothers in Crucita, so you might try that for a night, or just go somewhere else in Manabi, the next day we went to Montecristi, and later to Canoa, we spent one night there and then returned to Montañita, spent another night there, same hotel and all, next morning (and last of this part of our trip) we went back to Playa Rosada, it definitely was one of our favorites. We were not able to stop by San Clemente, but it's lovely there as well! Also, take into account that we were able to do all of this in a small period because of the car, it was soooo much easier to move everywhere, and the gas is not that expensive. Also, since hotels are very affordable there, you may decide to stay longer if you really like a place, so it's up to you really how much time to spend at any beach/town. Now I want to go to the beach. :)",
                    "Second Los Frailes, I went there as a kid and it was beautiful. I would also add to go to playa escondida, it’s a beautiful ‘private’ beach in esmeraldas. It’s owned by an ecological lodge. If you can sleep there there is very few people, the cabañas are cozy and there are some rivers but you can also just go to the restaurant, it’s really good and you have access to the beach.",

                    "I have visited Ecuador many times and we are in a healthy relationship. She has a passport but has never left the Andean Community. I’ve heard a lot of horror stories about Ecuadorians dealing with the US embassies in attempting to acquire a visa to the US. Any of you have experience in the matter? The time table? I want to be able to enroll her daughter in kindergarten here which is only 4 months away. Is that feasible?",
                    "I married an Ecuadorian and got him a CR1/IR1 visa. Four months is not feasible unless you intend to commit visa fraud, which would be bringing her in on a tourist visa (IF, and that's a big if, you can get her one), marry her, and adjust status stateside. Like someone else said, she wouldn't be able to leave the States, work, etc during that process unless she gets a special permit.",
                    "The easiest thing to do would be to marry her  in Ecuador and start the CR1 visa process. It will take somewhere close to a year but it's much easier in the long run when compared to the K1 (fiance) visa, because there is no adjustment of status, etc, just an update from  the CR to the IR after two years of marriage.",
                    "A great resource for you is visajourney.com which is a forum with step by step explanations of the different visas, as well as thousands of people to hat have already gone through the same process or are doing it simultaneously. I'd strongly suggest giving it a look.",
                    "I have been browsing visajourney. That is where I heard stories of people being denied despite being married or promising to marry.",
                    "Can she visit the US, we get married, she goes back to Ecuador while we go through the residency process, as to not falsify the visitation visa? Also, a family member who lives in Ecuador said that the US embassy denies visas after they reach a certain number per month, regardless of whether a person qualifies or not. For instance, the state department says, “only 200 people per month can be approved for their visa”, and after that 200 is met no one will be approved.",
                    "I'm sure there are caps to visa numbers, but I wouldn't be able to accurately speak to the validity of that statement. What I can say is that getting a tourist visa for the average person is hard. My husband tried 3 times and got denied each time before we just said to hell with it and got married, and my in laws have all been denied multiple times despite have mortgages, jobs, savings, etc.",
                    "If she does manage to get a tourist visa, you could get married and have her leave to do the CR1 visa, but I doubt anyone would give her a visa to visit being that her intent is to get married while here. That's what the K1 visa was made for, basically.",
                    "If you do decide to do the CR1, keep in mind that as her American spouse, you have a right to be present at her eventual visa interview. I was, and although I don't know that it helped sway the outcome, it made me feel better. The biggest thing is to be honest and provide tons of proof of your relationship. It's really not a terrible process, you just have to make sure you read up on the different steps and do them correctly so you don't get caught up on small details.",
                    "Thanks a lot. This is encouraging and helpful. Did you ever think to hell with it and want to move to Ecuador? Obviously the economy isn’t as healthy there but at least you can fly in and stay for half the year on a tourist extended visa without much hassle.",
                    "Actually I've already lived there for several years, including during the CR/IR visa process. I was an exchange student there in high school and I liked it so I moved there, and went to college there. I met my now husband during my high school time there and we dated during college, and eventually got married when I couldn't manage to bring him for a visit. It's a great country and I loved living there. We'd still be there, but I wanted to expand my career a bit and hubby wanted to go to school here. We'll move back eventually, I'm sure.",
                    "Good luck with whatever you decide to do! Don't be intimidated by scary internet stories. Whether you go there or she comes here, both are very doable processes, they just take time. My Ecuadorian residency was actually a much bigger headache than my husband's American residency, lol",
                    "Thanks again. This is encouraging. I would love to spend even more time there but I don’t have a degree and I am not fluent in Spanish yet so I don’t think I have a marketable skill there, although who knows, there could be something. I’d rather sell cherries from a wheel barrel than  not be able to spend time with my girlfriend and her daughter, as cheesy as that sounds!",
                    "For what it’s worth, the elementary school nearest to my house has a full time ESOL program so her daughter is set when she arrives here. And my girlfriend has a biotechnology degree and is a math whiz. The US should be inviting them, not making things more difficult.",
                    "Depending on what area her degree is in, and from where she got it, she might not be able to make use of it here. I have many friends who were teachers, engineers, biologists, etc in Ecuador that either had to go back to school to get recertified or had to start over in another field. Unless she is coming from an accredited institution or has copious amounts of reputable experience, I would do some serious research before resting on any laurels.",
                    "You should also look into the legal ramifications of bringing her daughter with her. If she were your child there would be no problem, but as she isn't I'd imagine you'll need to prove that her father is okay with her moving abroad, etc. I really don't know what that process looks like, but visajourney should come in handy for that.",
                    "Again, good luck!",
                    "Currently adjustment of status is taking 30 months,  I'm one of those....been waiting almost 2 years now.  Best bet is fiance visa for quicker result",
                    "Mine is showing 30 months, in a big city though. Agree to disagree.",
                    "Depends on the type of the Visa If it's for touring, they will ask for tickets and hotel reservation and all of that",
                    "Now ,Visa to live there ??? That's another Galaxy of problems",
                    "Check with your lawyer if it's better to marry here , and then apply for Visa",
                    "Or travel as tourist and marry in USA",
                    "How did you meet her? And how did your relationship developed?",
                    "Seems like you've never lived in Ecuador and she has never left Ecuador...so how? This is the exact same question that the embassy will have for you.",
                    "She and her sister (who is a lawyer) were roommates with my uncle, who has retired in Ecuador. We met through him and I visited her, I have a passport full of consecutive tourist visas, and we have a log on WhatsApp of constant texting and video chats. Literally everyday.",
                    "Her mom has foreigners living in her house all the time. She currently has a Japanese woman who works with children there and the foundation she works for pays the housing expenses. Her sister (the lawyer) also has a foundation that deals with children, and I was told that she could get me a residency/work visa through that no problem. But I would have to figure out how to make money.",
                    "I got married to an American while here in the states and it took me 1 year to get work permits and 3 to get a Green card. Depending on how much you can wait to be apart from your fiancee you'll have to consider your options. Also if she's denied a Visa the first time, unless if it's for some violation she's committed, you can always apply again until you get it. It helps to be financially stable cause the government will look into your finances to ensure you could provide for both of you as to make sure you won't be needing government assistance in any way.",
                    "Marrying her there is another complicated route.  Ecuador requires you to live for over 90 consecutive days in Ecuador to get married there. As the tourist visa in Ecuador is only good for 90 days in a year period, you can't (legally) marry her in Ecuador unless you stay there 90 days AND get an extension to the 90 days..",
                    "So my wife and I went to Bahamas. I am from USA, she is Ecuatorian. We both can go there without visas. Bahamas requires you to be there 24 hours before you get married. And we did. We then submitted all necessary paperwork  (make sure to bring wedding certificate WITH APOSTILLE with you!) in Ecuador to legalize the marriage Took about 6 to 8 weeks and we got that done.",
                    "In my case, I am working on a permanent residence to go live there with her. But we did apply for a tourist visa for her (once already married), paid $400, and was denied without much explanation. And they keep the fee. Is a kind of a roulette thing. The consulate seems to assume the visitor plans to stay unless you can convince them otherwise.",
                    "But you can get an extended tourist visa and then get married. I guess it would be worth looking into the marriage requirements of Peru and Colombia as well. What do you plan to do in Ecuador? My girlfriend insists that the job market sucks and it’s much more realistic to move to the US. And she loves Ecuador, she doesn’t want to leave for any other reasons than economic ones.",
                    "I work in the software industry and the company I work for in the USA has distributors in several Latin Countries. As much of the work is done remote, they don't mind me doing it from Ecuador (home office) and I can travel to the different countries as needed from there.",
                    "I am from Puerto Rico, moved to the USA 35+ years ago. I have seen many latins come and return, and many come and stay. In our case, my wife is very close to her family, does not speak a word of English (well, maybe one or two), and her whole work/friend/family universe is there. I truly do not think she would get used to been here, even in FL where there are many Spanish speakers.",
                    "It is not out of the question. In a few years we might decide to come this way, even if for a while. For now, my salary (USA) goes a long way there and we already have a house, furniture, a car, our dogs, etc... :-) I do want her to come with me meet more family here and visit/travel, this is why we are trying for the tourist visa."

Depending on how much you can wait to be apart from your fiancee you'll have to consider your options. Also if she's denied a Visa the first time, unless if it's for some violation she's committed, you can always apply again until you get it. It helps to be financially stable cause the government will look into your finances to ensure you could provide for both of you as to make sure you won't be needing government assistance in any way.",

                    "It's going to depend on your constitution. Despite others asserting it's all good, even water that is constituted drinkable has bacteria in it. If you grew up here, your body has developed ways of fighting these bacteria. If you're new, your body will have a harder time figuring it out.",

                    "What I've personally found, after living for 4 years in various places in South America (not just ecuador), is that it's not a good idea to do something just because someone else has done it and they say they're fine.",

                    "Let me know if you have any questions.",
                    "Oh and btw, be careful with the cheap water bottle filters. I'm not going to make any sweeping statements, but a lot of the economical ones are more for filtering out chlorine and improving taste, instead of bacteria, pesticides, ameobas, and other nasties. Just do your homework on whatever you end up getting, I know some people that have been unpleasantly surprised when they found out the hard way that their filter wasn't thorough enough.",

Most docs, even little clinics in grocery stores or pharmacy stores will write you a preemptive prescription. I just did this on our trip to India and was so happy. My sickness came on hard and fast and I don't think I could have made it out of the hostel room much less to the doctor.",
                    "Third, you can buy pedialite in those little powder stick packets now. I recommend a few of those along with immodium and pepto in your travel medical kit.

You can get a 2 gal bottle to refill your bottle and leave it in the hotel. It’s more an urban legend that we don’t drink it from the tap.  Just get supermarket water and you are done!!",

                    "Depends on the city, usually Quito and Cuenca have good tap water, Guayaquil does not. Although not always true I would say cities in the coast do not have reliable tap water, highland cities with populations over 100k are usually ok. This is a generalization but as an Ecudorian, I would only drink water from Quito, Cuenca and Loja, not from Guayaquil.",
                    "Yeah, no. We are not a fucking dysentery ridden country. Drink away mate and watch less unicef documentaries. They exaggerated a little bit",
                    "It comes down to what your body is accustomed to. If you live there and consume it, you will adjust. It also may depend where you go too. When I stayed near Tungurahua I got sick from the water more than once. That was when I would get lazy and drink it straight here and there though. When I used a handpump filter, I didn't get sick.",
                    "Okay, don’t be stupid either. If you go to a village where water is logically not treated then boil it and put a microdose of chlorine or something man",

                    "DO NOT drink the water on the coast! Guayaquil is probably fine, Quito is, maybe Manta. I don't know about Galapagos. Also, if you are worried about water born bacteria, always ask if your food was prepared in purified water (especially salad, etc...) and your ice!! if you get ice in drinks, or juice / smoothies that include ice, always ask if the water used was purified water. I've even gotten sick from hot coffee that was not made with purified water in the Guayaquil airport. That was a plane flight to forget.",
                    "If you do start feeling sick, immediately take a Bactrim. If you can keep it down without throwing up, it should be 1 and done, and you'll feel better in a few hours, normal by the next day. If you wait too long to take it, you will throw it up and you'll have an incredibly rough day or two.",
                    "If you are careful and take precautions, you should be just fine and you'll have an amazing trip. Enjoy!! Its a great country with a lot to offer.",
                    "I'm in Quito right now. You can drink the water in Quito if you boil the water. I have been told and read that other towns don't have as clean water as Quito does.",
                    "Do not drink the tap water in Tena or Baños de Agua Santa. The problem is the pipes. Some of the bigger cities have potable water but the pipes are really old and dirty so you dont know what is in there. Agree with other posters. Buy a big gallon bottle and leave in hotel room. But if you are out all day, you will need more than one bottle of water to stay hydrated if its hot or at altitude.",

                    "Hi everyone! First time poster here/ long time on looker interested in this beautiful country. Planning a trip for next April to all of the places mentioned in the title and was just looking for some information on thing to look out for having never been to the country before or South America. I've heard some negative things about traveller safety there and was wondering if I can get some insight from both natives to the country and frequent travellers!",
                    "Any advice??",
                    "EDIT: Thanks for the advice so far everyone!! Helpful and reassuring that everyone seems to be in agreement with the things to look out for and the level of safety",
                    "Ecuador is pretty safe, there is the usual petty theft that can happen anywhere at any time, but they are not really that common.",
                    "This is common sense, not really advice:",
                    "Don't walk alone very late at night in isolated places.",

                    "Avoid flaunting your expensive watch or other jewrly while on the street.",
                    "Try dressing as simple as you can, so that you don't catch the attention of bad people.",
                    "When using a taxi, ask before hand to people around you how much does the trip cost from where you are to where you are going, some taxi drivers overcharge foreigners because they don't what a taxi trip costs here.",
                    "Good advice above.",
                    "In Quito, legitimate taxis have a 4-digit number on an orange placard. Calling for a taxi is safer than hailing one at night.",
                    "When riding on a bus, try to sit on the same side as the compartment under the bus where they put your suitcase so you can look out the window and see if anyone grabs it. This isn’t common, but does happen from time to time.",
                    "Keep your most valuable things in a bag on your lap on buses. The bag below the bus should be all replaceable.",
                    "Or just use Uber/cabify",
                    "Baños and Galapagos are very safe because they are touristic destinations. Quito and Guayaquil have some sketchy areas but touristic areas are safe, watch out for pickpocketers in crowded places. For example, it would be bad to walk in Centro de Quito with a huge backpack. If you are going to use taxis in Quito/Guayaquil it's safer to get an Uber/Cabify/EasyTaxi.",
                    "What negative things have you heard?",
                    "Mainly theft/muggings being fairly common in Quito, sometimes of the violent variety. As well as bag slashing on buses",
                    "Everyone did a pretty good job of answering imo. I live in Baños with my pregnant wife and 2 little girls.",
                    "Jut use basic travel smarts and you'll be ok. Ecuadorian are super friendly.",

                    "Good advice on the water. I recommend getting a water filter of your own if you want to travel a lot. Some stores close pretty early and it's a pain if you are out of fresh water.",
                    "Careful with large sums of money, watch your stuff when on public transportation. There are sticky fingers here.",

                    "Hope you enjoy your stay! I just finished an article on the swing of the end of the world, definitely check it out when you're in Baños!",
                    "Agreed with u/TryHardPantiesOn, Ecuador is pretty safe for travelers, specially in touristic areas such as those mentioned.  Tourists should be cautious as in any place in the world for pickpocketers, and specilly phone thiefs.  Try not to fling your phone around big crowds or without making sure no one suspicious is around.In Quito, touristic areas such as the Colonial area are police-guarded at all times.  Taxi drivers usually charge with meter here, alwasy ask for a metered ride.  Guayaquil has  charming touristic spots also guarded and safe. Taxi drivers don’t use meter here, you have to agree on the fare beforehand.  Never get in a cab without agreeing as they may overcharge you by a lot.  Baños and Galápagos are absolutely 100% tourist friendly and safe...ENJOY",
                    "Do not take a yellow taxi in Guayaquil. This is not a dangerous city but some of those fuckers are known for kidnapping people, two of my friends have being kidnapped for their money. Use Uber or other service but dont take one in the street",
                    "I've heard this as well which has made me cautious to any cab at all, but does uber make it safer? Or is there still a chance of that happening?",
                    "Uber is way safer, also you can use other private companies that we call “taxi amigo”.",
                    "Awesome, I'll look into it! Thanks for the help",
                    "Quito taxis are installed with video and Panic button that are connected with ECU 911, they implemented this in order to deter kidnappings, never needed to use it but once you press it it sends a signal to 911 dispatchers",
                    "Uber/Cabify/Easy Taxi or \"taxi amigo\" (private taxis) are safer because they give you details about the driver and the car you are going to take. Also they give a better service overall.",
                    "Yellow taxis have a bad service most of the times, may overcharge you, sometimes the drivers won't accept to take you to the place you want if it's not convenient for them.",
                    "Maybe an additional tip is, be careful when you go to an ATM to get money don't withdraw too much and be aware of your surroundings. Sometimes muggers are looking closely to people who are withdrawing fairly large amounts of money. Besides Quito, Guayaquil and Galapagos, there are not many places that accept credit card, so try to use cash whenever possible.",
                    "Concerned about this as well...I was planning on taking out all the money I need before I leave home, then any time we are out of the hotel bring only the money we need and leaving the rest in a safe",
                    "Well, that is a good idea. Just in case, when you go out, try to distribute the money in some pockets besides the wallet. That way it wont look too bulky. In places too crowded, be aware of the people surround you. Sometines watching someone suspicious to the eyes make them go away. This is highly unprobable, but better be safe than sorry!. And enjoy it!",
                    "My husband is from Ecuador and we spent two weeks there last summer. We stayed mostly in Quito with a side trip to Otovalo.  I loved it so much that we’re going back for 2.5 weeks this summer. Admittedly I wasn’t out and about at night very much (we have a kid and we  stayed with relatives) in Quito, but I never felt unsafe. His nephew did suggest we remove our gold necklaces (simple cross/star of David) as a precaution and we kept our phones/wallets in a front pocket or, in my case, my bra, but that’s common sense in any large city anywhere in the world. Just keep an eye on your surroundings, pay attention to your wallet and phone, remove flashy jewelry, etc.  As others have said, if you stick to the touristy areas you’ll be just as fine as you’d be in touristy areas in the US or Europe.",
                    "Health safety. When you get in country, go to any pharmacy and ask for BACTRIM,  it is an antibiotic you can get there over the counter for about 20 cents a pill. Keep several pills with you at all times during your travel.",
                    "DO NOT drink the water on the coast!  Guayaquil is probably fine, Quito is. I don't know about Galapagos. Also, if you are worried about water born bacteria, always ask if your food was prepared in purified water (especially salad, etc...) and your ice!!  if you get ice in drinks, or juice / smoothies that include ice, always ask if the water used was purified water.  I've even gotten sick from hot coffee that was not made with purified water in the Guayaquil airport. That was a plane flight to forget.",
                    "If you do start feeling sick, immediately take a Bactrim.  If you can keep it down without throwing up, it should be 1 and done, and you'll feel better in a few hours, normal by the next day. If you wait too long to take it, you will throw it up and you'll have an incredibly rough day or two.",
                    "If you are careful and take precautions, you should be just fine and you'll have an amazing trip.  Enjoy!!  Its a great country with a lot to offer."

Admittedly I wasn’t out and about at night very much (we have a kid and we  stayed with relatives) in Quito, but I never felt unsafe. His nephew did suggest we remove our gold necklaces (simple cross/star of David) as a precaution and we kept our phones/wallets in a front pocket or, in my case, my bra, but that’s common sense in any large city anywhere in the world. Just keep an eye on your surroundings, pay attention to your wallet and phone, remove flashy jewelry, etc.  As others have said, if you stick to the touristy areas you’ll be just as fine as you’d be in touristy areas in the US or Europe.",

So i had valid onward travel but the Copa airlines staff who checked my papers saw the the date that I was issued the visa (a month earlier in the uk) and were worried it started then and not upon arrival to ecuador.

                    "Just came back from my Quito trip and there were stray dogs everywhere.",
                    "Do shelters not exist? Do people not spay and neuter dogs? Are people just buying dogs and dumping them on the streets?",
                    "I will say IMHO some progress is been made. The problem is not resolved overnight. It takes teaching society a better way.",
                    "First, many of the dogs on the streets do belong to a family that feeds them etc. They just seem to believe is ok to leave them outside to roam the streets. So while they might have a home, you see them loose. The problem that generates is lots of litters been born with no owners, and spread of disease.",
                    "My wife works as a rescue for dogs. She constantly picks up dogs, haves them neutered/spayed, and either finds them a home or returns them to the local area where they live. She is not the only one. She also organizes events where a government bus comes over and they do spay/neuter at low/no cost. She then gets people from the neighborhood to bring their dogs to the event.",
                    "Just last week we took 3 dogs to get spayed. The clinic (public funded) does free spay/neuter on appointment. They do 35 to 50 EACH DAY. The next available appointment is for SEPT 2018! So this shows (to me) owners are hearing the message and trying to do the right thing. Some people there had 2 or 3 pets to fix. Unfortunately this is a local clinic to a certain area and not all areas of the city have this kind of program.",
                    "I find the hearts of a lot of the young people are into this. I think the culture is changing with respect to treatment of pets. But, again, will take time and mostly education of the younger ones to grow up to see their pets in a different light.",
                    "And, if compared to USA, lets not kid ourselves : the pet problem is not solved, is just hidden away. No animals roam the streets, they get picked up and many end up killed in brutal ways. Is that better? I am not sure. You don't have to solve a problem you don't see. As long as they get killed out of sight, further action is not needed. It is very sad.",
                    "That's great to hear that there is an effort to help the problem.",
                    "In the USA yes it's true we have kill shelters usually run by the city. But a lot is done so the animals don't have to be put down:",
                    "Pet shops in certain parts of the country can no longer sell dogs from breeders instead they display animals from local shelters up for adoption",
                    "Most shelters have foster programs where the animals can be placed until adopted",
                    "No kill shelters will sometimes adopt from the city shelters",
                    "Yes, we have a problem here too and it is sad. I think the difference is a lot of Americans are more aware, we have organizations like HSUS and ASPCA that make us feel awful about it constantly.",
                    "Quito is nothing compared to rural parts of the country, basically no one gives a shit and people pretend the problem doesn't exist. My butt cheek in Puyo will attest to this.",
                    "People are stupid. I come from a small city (Loja) where the mayor opened shelters where they decided all stay dogs had to go, and if they weren’t adopted in a few weeks they had to be put down.",
                    "Oh the outcry, very hypocritical people claiming it’s wrong to kill them and blah blah blah ... you wouldn’t believe the comments one would read on Facebook. ??????????",
                    "People are simply dumb and don’t realize these are problems that need to be solved and mayors just are not good enough at enforcing decisions because they are afraid they will lose the elections.",
                    "However things are different every day , in 2018 it’s pretty common to have them neutered, unfortunately in the rural areas it is different since people are less educated there.",
                    "I am also from Loja and I remember all the whining from people in the city and also from meddlesome whiners from the rest of the country who cried about the poor dogs but they didn't even bother trying to adopt them, all they did was pointlessly cry a lot about the matter as though that was going to help anybody.",
                    "But education, long term, is the key. As you state people have cells and go to Facebook, etc... the same media can be used to pass along the information. Young people today become adults later. The mayor would be better advised to invest on low/free cost neuter/spay clinics, even if just one/two days a week. Over time this will start to make a dent. Even if they pickup strays, neuter/spay and re-release over time the tide can be turned. It won't happen on a week or a month, not even a year. But a few years down the road things could be very different.",
                    "This has been available for years in my city but people still get too sentimental, and it’s people who are more prepared who don’t realize the dimensions of the problem. They expect someone to adopt every stray and that isn’t going to happen.",
                    "Totally understand. My wife (FB: Colitas Felices) also wants to pickup every stray, totally impossible. :-( She gets frustrated but is not something you can solve overnight. Even for any number of shelters the size of the task is impossible.",
                    "Also I find Ecuatorians do have a sense of \"socialism\" in some issues. There is a recent video going around in FB where some well intended people pickup a cat and drop it off in front of a vet clinic. A battle insude as the vet can not take on the responsibility to help every stray. But the (again, well intended) people expect the vet to help the stray \"for free\"... The see the need of one and now the total size of the issue.",
                    "Long term, programs to educate in schools and grow a new generation with a new conscience is the way to go.",
                    "No, there are no shelter culture. In some cities they created and people freaked out when they found out they kill the dogs after a time if no one comes for them. The problem was the stray dogs, they were no neuter so they reproduce a lot and created a huge problem because no one want to kill the dogs and the animal protection foundations are at maximum capacity. But the problem is reducing a lot since 2010 because the are goverment (local and national) campains to neuter stray dogs and cats.",
                    "Answering your other questions, no, most of the stray dogs are mainly decendants of another stray dogs. There are of course terrible people that dumps dogs, but they are like in the rest of the world a minority, is pretty common here that if you don't or can't have your dog anymore, you search a new home for him via social networks and animal protection foundations.",
                    "I'm inclined also, like most of my people, that the dogs should be free to live and no end up in public shelters that kills them in some time. Most of them can't have descendants now, so when they age and die, the problem is gone.",
                    "Hey, ferchoec, just a quick heads-up:goverment is actually spelled government. You can remember it by n before the m.Have a nice day!",
                    "The parent commenter can reply with 'delete' to delete this comment.",
                    "Yeah, it's definitely one of the aspects of Ecuador that puts a bit of a damper on a visit. It would be seriously expensive to do something about it that was humane, so I'm guessing nothing will happen as long as the economy is doing poorly.",
                    "Disclaimer: This is my opinion. Dogs are tools here, used to protect property. I live on the coast. My guardian has a dog and 2 cats (that I paid to neuter). One cat has died due to poisoning from a neighbor, as well as 3 neighbor dogs.",
                    "Unlike the US and Canada, they don't catch and kill strays here. Plus it's rare to fix them here.",
                    "Pet abandonment and in general animal cruelty are bad here in Ecuador, but there are many people and ONGs trying hard to improve the situation. I happen to volunteer for one of those in Guayaquil. Should anyone be interested in adopting a dog or a cat, or helping out, or just visiting, just PM me, or go to FundacionAmigosConCola @ FB.",
                    "It is a big problem :(",
                    "Yes, it's sad to see and creates health issues too. Aside of this and I don't completely understand why, some people own dogs but let them live all day on the streets..."

Young people today become adults later. The mayor would be better advised to invest on low/free cost neuter/spay clinics, even if just one/two days a week. Over time this will start to make a dent. Even if they pickup strays, neuter/spay and re-release over time the tide can be turned. It won't happen on a week or a month, not even a year. But a few years down the road things could be very different.",

Can anyone recommend a company for this? I'm looking to bring between 25-35 people.",

No soy para nada de los venezolanos que roban, solo soy alguien que quiere trabajar para una mejor vida! Tengo unas cuantas preguntas para sobrevivir en su hermoso país durante el tiempo que estaré allá. Mi principal objetivo es ahorrar lo más que pueda, y cualquier consejo que tengan sobre este aspecto en general es bienvenido. Tengo unas cuantas preguntas específicas, y les agradecería sus respuestas. Todas las opiniones y consejos son bienvenidos.",

                    "Gastos de vida. Con cuantos dólares debo contar teniendo en cuenta los recursos básicos: comida, toilet paper, renta, transporte etc.",
                    "Qué tan costoso es el transporte y qué consejos me tienen para no gastar tanto en esto?",
                    "Salarios razonables. Estoy dispuesto a trabajar por un poco menos en comparación al ecuatoriano, pero tampoco quiero ser esclavo. No estoy muy seguro de los salarios alla, así que me gustaría que me dijeran que salarios razonables puedo aceptar para subsistir y ahorrar lo que pueda.",

                    "Hola. Creo q puedo ayudar en algunas de las cosas que mencionas.",
                    "Los ecuatorianos son bastante amigables, no creo q se te dificulte conocer gente decente y que te trate bien.",
                    "Respecto al trabajo, creo que si supiera qué profesión tienes se podría proveer una mejor orientación. En Ecuador sí hay plazas de trabajo si sabes buscar y tienes buena actitud. Hay mucho extranjero vendiendo cosas en la calle, pero también hay otros que trabajan en restaurantes. En general, el trato que uds dan a los clientes es del agrado del ecuatoriano. Así qué, si quieres trabajar de mesero te recomiendo buscar alternativas en restaurantes donde las propinas sean buenas, es decir, restaurantes de clase media-alta. Si te gusta la docencia también hay oportunidades.",
                    "Respecto a la comida, nuestra gastronomía es buena. No tendrás problemas con eso. Sólo no comas mucho en la calle.",
                    "Cuánto necesitas para vivir decentemente? Si vives solo, puedes encontrar apartamentos, en Guayaquil, en sectores urbanos y agradables, hasta $100-120 x mes. Ten en cuenta que el salario básico es $386. En comida, si cocinas todas tus comidas y vives solo puedes estar gastando hasta $100 mensuales. Transporte, la ciudad está bastante conectada con el servicio de metro, y la tarifa es de $0.30. Cuánto vayas a gastar en transporte dependerá de qué tan lejos vivas fe tu trabajo. Te recomiendo comprar una motoneta. Las más baratas están por los $1000 y gastas muy poco en gasolina. Con un vehículo así te movilizas muy bien y rápido en Guayaquil.",
                    "1) Para ser un buen ciudadano, al igual que en cualquier lado, se amigable, ayuda a los demás, respeta el espacio de otros, no hables mal de nadie...lo clásico.",
                    "2) Los gastos varían mucho dependiendo tu estilo de vida. Si no sales, ahorras una pequeña fortuna. Si preparas la comida, en lugar de pedirla, ahorras también mucho, la diferencia entre cocinar y ordenar comida, es abismal. Un internet común estará en unos 20-30 (entre 10 a 20 megas). El agua unos 5-10 dependiendo la zona. Luz unos 20 a 40 dependiendo la zona. (Todos estos precios son en total, si compartes con alguien, los divides). Depende cuánto comas y qué tan variada sea tu alimentación, pero en general, frutas y verduras son baratas. You diría qué máximo unos 100 en comida, unos 70 si compartes con alguien (140 entre ambos). Lo más duro en Quito es el arriendo, pero al igual que en todo lo demás, depende de qué tan bien quieras vivir. Nada por debajo de los 120 es digno, pero existe.",
                    "3) El pasaje cuesta 25 centavos. Caminar siempre es una buena alternativa y además existe un sistema de bicicletas en el centro y norte de la ciudad que es gratuito, así que puede ayudarte en algo.",
                    "4) El básico está en 385, más los beneficios de ley que son el 13 y 14 salario. Como la gente es un asco cuando se trata de obedecer las leyes cuando contratan a inmigrantes, yo esperaría algo por los 320, todo bajo eso es robo total.",
                    "5) Siempre la comida más barata la encontrarás en los mercados mayoristas. San Roque/Mayorista Sur/Ofelia son los 3 donde conseguirás los precios más bajos. Si prefieres algo no tan caótico, los mercados normales, son los siguientes en la lista de precios bajos. El Mercado Central es el más famoso de esos. Coral supermercado y Santa María, son los menos costosos en la lista de hypermarkets. Las tiendas comunes de barrio son las más caras de todas, nunca compres ahí, salvo que sea necesario. No recuerdo varios precios, pero los huevos deben estar por los 13 centavos me parece. El pan igual por ahí. Las papas si las compras en el mayorista salen muy baratas.",
                    "6) La leche en funda es barata. El café para pasar lo compras por kilos y te dura todo el mes. La mejor de las cervezas de producción masiva es \"Club\", viene en varios tamaños, así que los precios varían. Las artesanales son las más ricas, pero cuestan más. Para qué jugos de caja, con frutas baratas? Compra una licuadora y listo.",
                    "7) La ropa es cara en el país, una camiseta sin marca bordea los 20 cuando en los países vecinos está por los 9. Así que, puedes darte una vuelta por Colombia, Ipiales está a 6 horas de Quito.",
                    "8) CNT, es la operadora estatal, los precios que tienen son los mejores del mercado, pero la oferta de celulares no es tan amplia como en Claro o Movistar.",
                    "9) Todas. Te darás cuenta que en Ecuador, la comida es algo a lo que casi se le rinde culto. Eso, sí, ten cuidado, la altura y comer algo pesado son una combinación terrible. TERRIBLE. Así que come ligero los primeros días, este país es ultra sopero, así que podrías probar eso para empezar.",

                    "Nueva Loja es una ciudad pequeña, muy distinto de la \"gran ciudad\" (Quito, Guayaquil). Eso puede ser bueno, o malo, también depende de tus expectativas y gustos (hay gente que prefiere los pueblos más pequeños, también puedes tener mas oportunidades).",
                    "Yo vivo en una ciudad grande, y se ven venezolanos por todos lados! Trabajan en peluquerías, vendiendo jugos y arepas en la calle (vendedores ambulantes), agentes de ventas, meseros en restaurantes, panaderias, etc.",
                    "Pienso que para un trabajo formal u oficial (en rol de pagos, etc) necesitarías visa de trabajo.",
                    "Pero hablando en general, la gente tiene en estima alta a venezolanos, porque se nota que tienen \"cultura de servicio\" (el ecuatoriano en cambio suele ser mal llevado o no tan bueno en el trato). También los venezolanos tienen mucha identidad: usan gorras o camisetas con la bandera o colores de Venezuela.",
                    "Tambien puede depender un poco del sector o barrio, puede haber el caso de que la zona donde llegues haya un poco de resentimiento o resistencia a venezolanos, quiza viendolos como competencia en plazas de trabajo. Pero eso diría que es la minoría, por lo general son bien aceptados.",

                    "Comida: Es economica si te adaptas a la gastronomia ecuatoriana, si quieres comer tal cual como comiamos en Venezuela en tiempos buenos, lo encontraras algo caro, ejemplo, desayunar una arepa diaria de jamon y queso, puede ser costoso.",
                    "Transporte: La mayoria de las ciudades utilizan buses por paradas, el costo es de 0.25ctvs a 0.30ctvs , es realmente barato y puedes llegar a cualquier lugar en bus, sin embargo, debes de tener cuidado con los taxis en la costa, ejemplo Guayaquil y Machala, ya que no ponen taximetro y tienden a inflarte los precios.",
                    "Telefonia: Te recomiendo Tuenti si buscas algo prepago, que simplemente recargues cuando necesites, de resto Claro o Movistar, funcionan con planes y depende de la situacion economica al menos al principio, puede hacerse dificil.",
                    "Jugos de caja o garrafas como las conociamos en Venezuela, hay muy pocos y son caros comparados con las gaseosas, es algo muy loco, aqui las gaseosas son hasta mas baratas que el agua.",
                    "Con respecto a gastos , con un sueldo minimo puedes manejarte bien, si alquilas habitacion barata puedes vivir comodamente. Depende de tu profesion, puedes conseguir trabajo casi que de inmediato o tardar un poco mas, ya que la sitacion laboral es dificil mas no imposible.",
                    "La comida que es un MUST depende del lugar, de guayaquil debes de comer los bolones, de cuenca el chancho o cuy , de quito las guatitas y de machala las menestras.",
                    "Con respecto a la ropa, es algo diferente a Venezuela, aqui se regatea mucho, algo a lo cual no me aconstumbro, trata de ir a mercados tipo La Bahia de guayaquil y consigues muy barato, pero tienes que regatear, algo que se me hace muy incomodo aun.",
                    "Bueno mi pana bienvenido, espero te vaya muy bien, cualquier cosa me escribes si quieres mas indicaciones o simplemente charlar (y)"

                    "I also posted this in /r/Quito but it looked pretty dead over there. I am an American from Portland, OR who was interested in becoming an expat in Ecuador. We scheduled our flights to come check it out for a few weeks and within a day of arriving in Quito, I had a medical emergency and have been in the hospital since Friday April 20th. Basically, I have the sickle cell trait and, in rare cases, altitude, atmospheric pressure, and low oxygen intake can lead to sickle cell symptoms and I had a infraction of my spleen. I am feeling better now and have been cleared for release but I have to go directly to the airport and I need to have a portable oxygen concentrator for my trip to the airport and flight home. The problem is my Spanish is poor and I can't locate one with enough battery power to get me home. Would anyone be willing to help me call around medical supply companies to find what I need? I am willing to compensate you for your time and I desperate need the help so I can go home to my daughter.",

The issue is that my flight is 6 hours and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) requires that you have enough battery to equal 150% of the total flight time (9 hours in this case). They also require that it is a specific make and model. I don't speak enough Spanish to find out if they sell the unit and enough batteries to get me back to the states. I'm hoping to find someone willing to either translate for me on the phone or that I could give all of the information and they could call around for me and I would be willing to compensate for the help.",

                    "Do to the retardation of our country from the presidency to school shootings every month, I'm starting to think that living in America is not  as good as it was. It seems that in Ecuador you may get robbed, but you won't get shot in your classroom.  Ecuador also has single payer healthcare. The food is not as processed and people seemed more generally happy down there when I visited.  I may not know what I'm talking about but I feel I better get out of the US  before shit really hits the fan.  My wife is has full citizenship there so I don't think it would be a problem.  Any one else feel this way?",
                    "Hm... my husband and I talk about this sometimes. I have citizenship, he does not. The main problem is lack of opportunity and low salaries. I don’t know what type of life you’re expecting but the cost of things like electronics, clothes, shoes, etc can be ridiculously expensive. Additionally, racism, sexism and classism are rampant, in addition to he whole bs of “Serrano” vs “Costeño” tribal crap that still goes on. You’ll still be incredibly privileged, but if you’re looking for a more progressive place, this is not it. Lastly, just like in America, people do get murdered by guns, you just have to live in the wrong place. Like up north, where my family is from.",
                    "There are definitely sacrifices, like an insecure postal system, lack of safe public transportation, and some scary looking bugs if you go deep into the rainforest. If you're willing to make the sacrifices, then it could be a good fit.",
                    "In my family, the opinions are mixed. Nearly everyone has been exposed to the United States, and a few chose to move to the USA for what they believed to be a better life. Many family members chose to stay in Ecuador mainly because that is where they grew up.",
                    "As an expat who lived in Ecuador for a number of years, just be warned that if you are a chill person with a lot of patience and more patience and some problem solving skills then you will like it. If you come and expect to be able to get post in less than 3 months or a fridge repaired without breaking again the next day or being overcharged or that letting your guard down for 2 seconds doesn't result in being pickpocketed then unfortunately you're gunna hate it here after 2 years or so. Ecuadorians don't see it and \"that's just how it works here\" while foreigners either can deal with it or get angry, bitter and pack their bags again. Ecuador can be lovely, but don't think you're running from a country with problems to one without any",
                    "Try the expats in Quito / expats in Ecuador Facebook groups. Also note that almost all foreigners (and all locals who are lower-middle class or higher) do pay for private health insurance (although the costs are nothing at all like the US)",
                    "Yes money does make life less stressful.",
                    "It's not about making life less stressful. It's about going in with a broken leg and them actually setting it straight so you don't spend the rest of your life with a wonky leg because some shitty doctor couldn't see what straight was. Or getting an infection because all the public doctors walk around town and catch public transport in their scrubs instead of steralising them, the hospitals don't even understand that's what scrubs are for. Having a public healthcare system is amazing and I can't imagine how many lives it has saved bevaus of it but don't expect all hospitals to be made equal",
                    "Danm haha",
                    "It's great to hear from someone who lived there. However some of those situations you described can be relatable to places here in the US. Do people get murdered in Ecuador at the rate they do in cities in the US?",
                    "Murder? Not as far as I've seen. It isn't common in the areas that a foreigner would live. Theft at gunpoint or knifepoint yes but in terms of actual violence (as long as you don't resist) not really. Almost all my female friends (locals or foreigners) have been attacked by a weapon-holding attacker at some point or another for their phone or whatever but it's like 90% of the time after dark. But actually the centre of Quito is pretty safe as long as it's not after dark. Guayaquil is a law until its own but if you were moving here to go to Guayaquil I'd get you sectioned anyway haha.",
                    "Ha yeah Guayaquil is an intimidating city for a white boy.",
                    "Haha it's an intimidating city for a local too! Guayaquil for Ecuador is what Detroit is to the US - if you're from there you know what you're doing but people not born there avoid it unless they lived not too far and were looking for work",
                    "I promise I'm not jaded against Ecuador, but it seems like you've looking to hear about the issues and not the good bits!",
                    "Hey man I lived in GYE aint that bad ):. If you live in Samborondon or la puntilla, it isn’t as bad as people think, you have 2 shopping malls (3 if you want to count El Dorado that just opened a few years, I heard it has the biggest screens in the city) but it’s closer to La Aurora. Now la puntillas has a very good hospital which is La Kennedy, and a nice farmacy called Fybeca, in front of the pharmacy there is a food plaza and behind it another food plaza with a bank on it. City in general can be safe if you know how to move on car or bus or walking but like this guy said if you where there is not visible light get ready to get rob and if you have children there is a bunch of good school around there too.",
                    "No, slightly higher per capita in Ecuador get murdered.",
                    "I had to look it up, but you're right.  Murder rate in Ecuador is 8.23 per 100,000 and in the U.S. it's 5.1 per 100,000.",
                    "That is old data. In the year 2017 Ecuador's murder rate was 5.8.",

                    "Also, not al provinces in Ecuador are equal, coastal provinces and the ones that border Colombia are far more dangerous that the rest of the country.",

                    "This map has outdated data, but the proportions remain the same, the Andean provinces are as safe as Chile nowadays (Quito might be excepted since it's the capital and has a lot of economic movement and that tends to attract the attention of criminals), while the coastal ones are still safer than most of the region but more dangerous than the Andean ones.",
                    "Thanks.  Good info to have as I'm headed there in a couple of months.",
                    "You dont know what you want, stay in the US or go to Europe.",
                    "As others have mentioned, it is a decision that should not be taken lightly. Ecuador has a TON of upsides but also has some issues. It has lower standards in most areas.",
                    "In the US you collect a 80k paycheck, drive into your clean, beautifully-architected suburb, get the latest products and gadgets for a relatively low price, get excellent medical attention and professionalism in most places. Most things are relatively consistently high quality.",
                    "In Ecuador you earn much less, it is less secure, it is less clean and there is more corruption plus higher prices for some things. But in Ecuador you can make an amazing weekend trip every week to the beach, the mountains or the jungle and it will not cost you a fortune. You might meet amazingly friendly and open people you will hang out with. You will enjoy a slower, more beautiful pace of life.",
                    "So it really depends on what you value. However, talk is cheap and thoughts and imagining can only bring you so far. Ideally, try the real thing. Try living there for 3,6,9 or 12 months and reflect on how you like it :)",
                    "Yup.  But I see both parties as working for the same corporations and am not looking forward to WW3 over lies to get us into Syria.  =)  Things seem to be on the brink of a major downturn in the good ole USA",
                    "The presidency? Okay, you think you're moving to this progressive land but religion has the same importance you might found at any republican state. Yes, you might get robbed but at least you won't get shoot with a gun on the street. Well, you want to move to my country, I want to leave it. Good luck anyway. To put it this way, you're going to live to a country where most would be moderate republicans socially speaking. Want a progressive land? Just don't move to any country in Latin America.",
                    "I lived in Ambato for a couple of years. I was an English teacher and really enjoyed my time there. It was difficult at first with needing something and the answer is always tomorrow even a week later. Get used to showing up places late because no one is ever on time. However, enjoy the low cost meals and the friendliness of the people. Traveling the country is easy and relatively safe as long as you aren’t acting like a stupid tourist. It’s awesome they are USD currency. Life is very enjoyable there if you don’t mind living according to their terms as a culture.",
                    "I too am considering a move to EC but I have to question your motives? Where in the US are you living that you actually worry about school shootings and being killed on the street? I live in the burbs in a repub state that has conceal carry. No worries about school shootings. No worries about walking around at night. Heck I don't even lock the door when I leave for the day. The keys are in the cars in the unlocked garage. As for healthcare .. don't you have insurance through your work ?",
                    "I am looking for a slower pace of life, if it can even get slower than the area I live in (never hear car horns or sirens). Better climate and cheap simple living so that we don't have to worry about working",
                    "Did the last school shooting happen in the suburbs in a Republican state? It's not the fear of being in a school shooting or anything like that. It's the culture of fear we live in now in the US. It's also the culture of live to work that sucks .",
                    "I haven't had live tv for at least 7 years, rarely read the news and don't do Facebook. It has done wonders to improve my mental state. I don't live in a culture of fear. The government and the news media want you to be fearful so that you willingly give up more rights in order to not be fearful. Just look at how much freedom and rights have been given up since 9/11 and people are still fearful. I honestly couldn't tell you where the last school shooting was or any of the last 3 for that matter. The culture of work to live is brought about by peoples desires for material things that they hope will bring them happiness. My newest vehicle is 12 years old and I haven't had a car payment or full coverage for years. I don't pay for cable TV. I was making 90K a year for most of the past decade prior to an accident that I had. Choosing to live a frugal lifestyle relieves much stress. Thankfully I chose that lifestyle because I had an accident 3 years ago which dropped my income down to 13k a year and I was able to still maintain my home with my SO's income from a part time (well full time according to Obama) job",
                    "Hi I read some of the answers and I couldn't help smiling :) specially when someone said something like \"Ecuadorians are always late\" as an Ecuadorian I can tell you THAT IS SO TRUE!! Good luck making your decision on moving to Ecuador",
                    "Wtf is this guy talking about",
                    "How is this irrational when many ex pats move to Ecuador every year.",
                    "Don’t listen to this fool, he is taking things extremely out of proportion. My country is fucking beautiful and the only thing that makes it bad might be people like him who spew massive amounts of shit over how Ecuador really is. Our president is transparent and rules based on the people’s will, takes advice from others and doesn’t disrespect  and discredit the media. Our currency is strong and the economic growth is stabilizing. The citizens are united and not nearly as polarized as in the US (except for people like this guy) There are no internal conflicts and cartels and gangs are not nearly as big of a problem to us as it would be to Colombia or the US (looking at you Chicago)",
                    "However do your own research, see who you agree with.",
                    "PS: Idiot is an extremist who posts awful stuff in nuclear wasteland toxic places like r/the_donald so you can’t expect much from him",
                    "He's just a lil insecure about how America is fucking itself up.  I know what he posted was bullshit... the only person that sees me as a walking ATM is my wife.",

It's about going in with a broken leg and them actually setting it straight so you don't spend the rest of your life with a wonky leg because some shitty doctor couldn't see what straight was. Or getting an infection because all the public doctors walk around town and catch public transport in their scrubs instead of steralising them, the hospitals don't even understand that's what scrubs are for. Having a public healthcare system is amazing and I can't imagine how many lives it has saved bevaus of it but don't expect all hospitals to be made equal",

If you live in Samborondon or la puntilla, it isn’t as bad as people think, you have 2 shopping malls (3 if you want to count El Dorado that just opened a few years, I heard it has the biggest screens in the city) but it’s closer to La Aurora. Now la puntillas has a very good hospital which is La Kennedy, and a nice farmacy called Fybeca, in front of the pharmacy there is a food plaza and behind it another food plaza with a bank on it. City in general can be safe if you know how to move on car or bus or walking but like this guy said if you where there is not visible light get ready to get rob and if you have children there is a bunch of good school around there too.",

I don't live in a culture of fear. The government and the news media want you to be fearful so that you willingly give up more rights in order to not be fearful. Just look at how much freedom and rights have been given up since 9/11 and people are still fearful. I honestly couldn't tell you where the last school shooting was or any of the last 3 for that matter. The culture of work to live is brought about by peoples desires for material things that they hope will bring them happiness. My newest vehicle is 12 years old and I haven't had a car payment or full coverage for years. I don't pay for cable TV. I was making 90K a year for most of the past decade prior to an accident that I had. Choosing to live a frugal lifestyle relieves much stress. Thankfully I chose that lifestyle because I had an accident 3 years ago which dropped my income down to 13k a year and I was able to still maintain my home with my SO's income from a part time (well full time according to Obama) job",

                    "Hi all, I'm a student from Ireland. I'm doing some my dissertation on the 'pink tide' and I've just a question to ask, what're the general attitudes towards Lenin Moreno, his reign and the current state of the country? Feel free to let loose!",
                    "It seems he is concerned enough about corruption and unveils some hidden stuff Correa did. But at the same time everyone surrounding him is or was with Correa which makes me doubt.",
                    "Since we are in debt more than the legal limit because of Correa’s corruption and overpriced deals there is no way that the country will recover in the near future no matter who is in charge so at least Moreno tries to stop the bleeding.",
                    "So are we better with Moreno? Yes Is the country in a good state? No",
                    "I really appreciate Lenin's general acceptance of different opinions and dialogue, and his promotion of free speech (even if it may all be a charade). Lenin is less of a hot-headed tinpot dictator than Correa was.  I also appreciate him opening up to the US and the EU, unmasking the true national debt, and somewhat reducing the size of the government.",
                    "With that said, I don't think his current economic policies are not good enough to pull Ecuador's economy forward significantly. A freer market has worked wonders for countries like Chile, and Lenin still enforces too many left-wing policies from Correa's government.",
                    "Additionally, I do not think he is strong enough leader to deal with tough situations like the current wave of terrorism up in Esmeraldas.",
                    "In conclusion, I appreciate him, but with a little distrust. With that said, Lenin is infinitely times better than Correa.",
                    "EDIT: Oh, I forgot to mention the referendum. He abolished unlimited presidential terms and increased the size of national parks. That's a huuuuuge plus!",
                    "You are all wrong, I'm pretty sure any of you are actually Ecuadorian so yeah, that thing you call \"Moreno\" is nothing but trash. I assume all the information you have about the current government is from THAT media. Lenin Moreno is a cynical liar, 0 socials labors so far and the only thing that piece of human trash talk is the typical \"the past government was corrupt\", he kicked out his vice-president cuz he got offended because he didn't like the content WHERE DID ALL THE DIFFERENT OPINION AND THE FREE SPEECH WENT???, in reality HE was part of THAT government. There was no way a guy like him could win so, how is he the president now? Treachery. He has no personality, he simply submitted to the Correa's enemies (not simples enemies they even tried to kill him at 30-S crisis, they got the control of the justice and arbitrary got to jail Correa's ministers, etc just like witch-hunting). And then Correa dictator..? I really got triggered by this.. Is the first time I've heard that not even the worst media here would say that, looks like the international one was really deadly enemies of \"the pink tide\". There is no dept the crude is at it's price right now. Please investigate very well this topic, Moreno is pretty much a puppet of the neo-liberlism tendencies, just search for videos, he did the ridiculous many times already the president trait is way to big for this Judas guy. Sorry 4 my bad English by the way.",
                    "Saca tu cabeza de la arena, pana. Y sí, sí soy ecuatoriano.",
                    "Him calling him Judas is a dead giveaway of him being of now defunct Ovis Aries group.",
                    "I agree with most of this. However, I'll add that imo the left-wing policies aren't inherently bad. The major reason why the country is in an awful situation and will be for a long time is the widespread corruption Correa left behind. Moreno right now is fighting against at least half of his own party still in positions of power who very vocally support Correa's return (that is if this whole rivalry isn't just a charade). Because of this, anticorruption policies to flush out every corrupt official have been hard to implement and the crisis in Esmeraldas hasn't helped. That said, I still think other candidates were a better option and I just hope Moreno is honest with his intentions and really is trying to stop the damage Correa did.",

Although many will say Lenin is more open to dialogue or that he is showing the corruption hidden In the last administration, that is just politics. Initially, the economic policy was  the same: continue with public investment and  adopting a cautious fiscal policy since we don’t have monetary policies. Nowadays I’m not really sure, he clearly does not understand all the economics aspects of the things he is accusing Correa, and his strategy has been of departing from the BIG shadow that the former president leave in the country, but that is just my opinion on him. For example take the debt issue: is it bad to have debt? Not necessarily, for me is more a meter of what type of debt you have, are financing permanent debt with permanent income? Are you using debt to finance investment?

The big support Correa got for 10+ years is due to taking care of the people who really need government investment. IMO a big reason for electing a government is to redistribute wealth, and he did. It was far from perfect but he got great results, many will say it was a waste of money, but for this “masses” it was really a life changing moment when they had the OPPORTUNITY to access public healthcare or public education or connectivity with the rest of the country.  If poverty or inequality or illiteracy or infant mortality rates had not been reduced I would call it populism as I think you were implying but that ain’t true, that’s why he got the support he got, because Ecuador is a low income country despite having fairly wealthy big cities",

For many years Correa was president he faced very low oil prices ( although in the beginning they were high), and now Moreno has higher prices which means more oil income, Under that logic is Moreno more corrupt, is it growing exponentially now or is it more of a linear  relationship, maybe a logistic growth?

It is a VERY serious issue in the world, I worked as an intern in the public sector some years ago and for me public sector corruption does not even depend on the government in charge, when I asked what was the average working years as public servants it was like 20 years, many people in Correa government were public servants before and continue to be with Moreno, they REALLY know how the internal mechanisms work and how to work around them, it is very costly to create controls where they can be stopped because they have “social corruption networks” that are well institutionalized, how can we break apart this mechanisms that prevails in our society and that many politicians take advantage when they are in power positions? For that I don’t have an answer.",

In general, most of Correa policies where not aimed to these people, I know a lot of them are furious about the corruption but if you go to many low income parts of the country you will see a different opinion. Although many will say Lenin is more open to dialogue or that he is showing the corruption hidden In the last administration, that is just politics. Initially, the economic policy was  the same: continue with public investment and  adopting a cautious fiscal policy since we don’t have monetary policies. Nowadays I’m not really sure, he clearly does not understand all the economics aspects of the things he is accusing Correa, and his strategy has been of departing from the BIG shadow that the former president leave in the country, but that is just my opinion on him. For example take the debt issue: is it bad to have debt? Not necessarily, for me is more a meter of what type of debt you have, are financing permanent debt with permanent income? Are you using debt to finance investment? But you will not see this debate since is to complicated/boring to be portrayed in the news, and as all know news want to sell a story not investigate on it.",

The big support Correa got for 10+ years is due to taking care of the people who really need government investment. IMO a big reason for electing a government is to redistribute wealth, and he did. It was far from perfect but he got great results, many will say it was a waste of money, but for this “masses” it was really a life changing moment when they had the OPPORTUNITY to access public healthcare or public education or connectivity with the rest of the country.  If poverty or inequality or illiteracy or infant mortality rates had not been reduced I would call it populism as I think you were implying but that ain’t true, that’s why he got the support he got, because Ecuador is a low income country despite having fairly wealthy big cities",

For many years Correa was president he faced very low oil prices ( although in the beginning they were high), and now Moreno has higher prices which means more oil income, Under that logic is Moreno more corrupt, is it growing exponentially now or is it more of a linear  relationship, maybe a logistic growth? How can we tell? Observation? Media coverage? Surveys? It is obvious corruption exists now and during Correa regime and before Correa",

In spite of the strong support he gets from the elites, the press and the old political system, he doesn't seem to get anything accomplished (besides demolishing Correa's legacy) in a country that desperately needs good leaders to address so many social issues. His supposed fight against corruption looks one-sided and politically motivated. He has betrayed the people who got him elected, and seems to be following the ideas of the politicians that vehemently opposed the government he belonged to for a decade. I understand why Correa's opposition find him useful, but I am sure deep down they know Lenin is just a tool, with little integrity and low personal or political significance.",

Correa wanted an easily manipulated puppet such as Medvedev in Russia to hold the presidency until he returned triumphally in 2021, you can say it did not work out that way, thankfully. He's becoming erratic and has lost the goodwill of the vast majority of Ecuadorians, and he's just a sad shadow of his former self.",

                    "Hi folks, I have a very close childhood friend who resides in Ecuador (unfortunately he was deported back just recently). Fortunately enough for him he is very tech savvy and we’re planning on opening up a “fixing smart phones business”. I figured if I bought parts for him from Alibaba.com and have it delivered to him it could actually work out. However I didn’t realize that they don’t have a shipping system like in the U.S where you normally order stuff online and it gets delivered to your door. He said that system doesn’t exist in Ecuador and unless he is wrong, could anyone of you guys help us out on how to do it? Is there a post office where we could send the merchandise to his name and have him pick it up? He resides in the city of Guayaquil.",

Here's how it works: Buy something and use the address for your friend's house in Ecuador. You must then go into the ecuador mail's website and input the tracking code of your package with a description of what it is and it's value. There's a flat rate of $3 or $4 per deliver and when the package gets here you'll be notified if there's any taxes to pay on top of that, usually if the package is over 4kg, I buy small electronic stuff from china and never pay any taxes. after paying the 3 or $4 online you'll receive the package in your address.",

                    "Ya sé que en Ecuador te piden un pasaporte válido por 6 meses para entrar. Pero por unos problemas y mala suerte párese que no voy a tener mi nuevo pasaporte en tiempo. Voy estar en Colombia antes y después quería ir a Ecuador por autobús. Mi plan era ir en abril por 2 semana max. Entonces mi pregunta es, que probable es que no me dejen entrar ? Tengo un pasaporte canadiense valido asta Julio. Y si no, me dejarían pasar para llegar a Perú por autobús. Gracias.",
                    "I know already that Ecuador is a country that requires you to have a valid passport for 6months to let you in. However due to some unfortunate issues it looks like I won't get my new passport in time. So I'm wondering how strict is this rule ? What are the chances I get in ? I will be in Colombia for a while then I was planing on going to Ecuador by bus. Staying for 2 weeks max in April. I have a Canadian passport valid until July. So how likely am I to be denied entry? Could I still travel through the country by bus to Peru? Thank you for reading.",
                    "In my experience it's a pretty cut and dry rule. It's definitely something they look for, and on entrance to the country you have to fill out customs forms that specifically ask when your passport is valid till. Immigration officers have given me flack for much smaller discrepancies for things on valid visas and passports I had going into the country - both through Quito/GYE airports, and the land crossing from Peru - and there have specifically been two occasions where they either wouldn't let me in or wouldn't let me leave until I could get the problem sorted out. Luckily it was a pretty simple fix both times but for something like a soon to expire passport, I don't think you'd be as lucky.",

                    "Hola todos! Mi esposa y yo nos mudaremos a Ecuador este verano (a Machala). No estamos planeando comprar un auto, ahora viajamos en bicicleta y autobús. Mi pregunta para usted es acerca de la disponibilidad de piezas de bicicleta en Ecuador, porque estoy tratando de decidir qué bicicletas traer y cuántas piezas de repuesto debo llevar. Específicamente, me preocupa la disponibilidad de neumáticos y tubos. Pienso que los neumáticos de 26\" son bastante comunes. ¿Pero qué pasa con 700c o 29\"? Además, ¿qué pasa con las cadenas? ¿Son comunes 8 velocidades? ¿Qué hay de 9, 10 o 11? ¿Hay algo más de lo que deba preocuparme que no esté considerando? Gracias por tu ayuda. Me disculpo por mi español mal (con la ayuda de Google Translate). Intento practicar leyendo, escribir y hablar antes de movernos. No dude en corregir cualquiera de mis errores gramaticales o palabras mal usadas. ¡Que tengas un gran día!",
                    "My spouse and I are moving to Machala, Ecuador this summer, ad we'd like to bring bikes, as we primarily travel by bike now (and we'll use the bus), and we don't plan on buying a car. I'm thinking I will bring the bikes we plan to use, but I'm curious if any other tire sizes other than 26\" are common, specifically 700c or 29\". Also, chains - I assume 1 and 8 are fairly common, but what about 9-11? I'm just trying to decide which bikes to bring and how many spares of things I might need to plan on having on hand. Thank you for tolerating my poor (but I'm working on it!) Spanish and for your help!",
                    "You will find any part you need, but maybe cycling in Machala Is not the safest, there are not bike lines and cars are not used to share the road... If you could try Cuenca is definitely most friendly with bicicletas",
                    "Thank you for that. My wife will be spending a little over a month there before we move, so she may check that out. We'll spend time in Cuenca, but her job will be in Machala.",
                    "Okay, thank you!",
                    "Cool! You guys will love it here, there are a lot of bike shop here so you can see if you can find what you need, It will considerable more expensive though",

As others have said, on the road you may not have a signal but in the centers of Salinas and Ancón you will have a decent connection. I do this all the time in pretty remote areas and get decent internet much of the time (but also sometimes a bad connection). Go to one of the CNT, Claro or Movistar stores and they will help you set it up. If you can find out which provider has a better connection in the area you will be in, that would help to decide. Locals should know this. Otherwise most hotels, rental houses, cafés and other spots will have wifi you can use. Have fun!",

As others have said, on the road you may not have a signal but in the centers of Salinas and Ancón you will have a decent connection. I do this all the time in pretty remote areas and get decent internet much of the time (but also sometimes a bad connection). Go to one of the CNT, Claro or Movistar stores and they will help you set it up. If you can find out which provider has a better connection in the area you will be in, that would help to decide. Locals should know this. Otherwise most hotels, rental houses, cafés and other spots will have wifi you can use. Have fun!",

Basically, I’m curious if there is a meme database (like KnowYourMeme, but I’ve found that site has seriously lacked regarding Latin American memes). Is there a specific site you can point me to?

                    "Hi there, I’m visiting Ecuador (Quito) in May. I usually travel by myself and I’m so excited to meet people. I have a few questions:",
                    "Anyone know what the car scene is like? Any meet ups? With all the mountains I’m sure there’s a strong car scene.",
                    "How’s the dance scene? Not night clubs, I mean dance hip hop. Street dancing.",
                    "Any fun sports matches I can see? Soccer/football looks to be the most popular. Are there matches in May?",
                    "Extreme sports? Looking to connect with people connected with some sort of subculture there.",
                    "You can go to Xtreme Valley in Nayon which is like half an hour from Quito, there you can find extreme sports and recreation, like the triangle of life which is canopy at an altitude of more than a thousand feet. Well there are lots of things to do. I hope you have a nice time staying and get some good memories from this city and country.",
                    "Edit: I guess that's not the best name for a traveling webpage, aside from that there you can find lots of great activities to do.",
                    "These are all great ideas thank you!",
                    "I’m more into meeting locals who know of cool experiences. More into that than “tourist stuff” tho I will definitely check out these two suggested here.",
                    "You can go to the churches catacombs, below Quito historic center",
                    "There will be soccer games going on when you are there. Check out this page from El Universo and scroll to the bottom half of the page to find a list of weekly schedules.",
                    "The dates and game times can change kind of last minute, but the site above gives an idea of who is playing each week and where. Four teams play home games in Quito: U. Católica, El Nacional, Liga de Quito, and Aucas. The first two teams both play at Estadio Olimpico Atahualpa, the most accessible stadium in central Quito. Liga plays in Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado, a stadium in north Quito. Aucas plays in Estadio Gonzalo Pozo Ripalda, which is in south Quito. I wouldn't recommend going to that final stadium on your own as a foreigner. You should be able to get tickets before any game at the box office, unless it's a big game.",
                    "Got it. Thank you!!!!",
                    "I like to go travel alone and make friends and do random cool shit so this is so exciting.",

                    "Thanks! Usually when I travel I just meet a bunch of random people, make friends, do some questionable dubious IG worthy things, and get fat eating. Lol. Tho this country is way too gorgeous to not go outside.",
                    "Hey man. You'll have a blast here.",
                    "When I just moved back to Ecuador I hit the CouchSurfing meet ups a few times. However, I just didn't find it too interesting. There are no sites like blablacar.com here, but travelling by bus is cheap, well connected and to my surprise (didn't ride buses in 5 years) they're more than decent nowadays.",
                    "Not a big street dancing place. Either way, I would suggest staying away from Plaza Foch - classic tourist trashy club area.",
                    "Soccer is the most popular sport, however don't expect a big adrenaline rush when going to stadiums, they are not as vibrant as Colombia or European stadiums. Unless you go to Guayaquil to Barcelona's stadium.",
                    "Are you going to be only in Quito? I live in Cuenca which is a one hour flight (7 hour drive) from Quito. If you decide to take a trip here give me a shout If you want to hang out and explore places here I'm down to hang out! I've been living here for a little over 5 years now! It's a nice place to live.",

I was wondering if you know of any websites and/or databases where I can research about the history behind the constitutional reform that brought about Article 71, ie why did they pass it and why in this form, and also about cases that followed, ie possible lawsuits that arise out of the rights of nature - I know there is one case about the Vilcabamba River, the Wheeler case. Preferably in English, please, as I do not speak Spanish.",

                    "Will there be any festivities or things to see in Quito on Saturday, the 24th of April (the night before Holy Week starts)?  Will Quito and Montanita be very busy?  Any tips would be great!  I am very excited :)",
                    "I think the correct translation for \"semana santa\" Is Easter! Anyway it's most a religious celebration and people who work in Quito and other cities usually use this time of the year to have Holidays with their families, some of them on the beach, so probably montañita Will have a lot of people. All over the country we prepare a special dish called \"fanesca\" that you have to try! But don't be too excited, because like I said it's a religious and spiritual week, you can go and pray!",

The Cucuruchos a people dressed in bright purple outfits kind of similar to the ku Klux klan (but in no way related) and they March though the streets, some wearing barbed wire, beating themselves or carrying religious artefacts as well as crucifixes  to show penitence and re enact the walk Jesus made to be crucified. It's really quite a sight and a chance to get some pretty unique photos. I'm not sure what day it will be on this year but perhaps keep an eye on this website to be updated for this year's schedule http://semanasantaquito.com/",

Al principio no había ningún problema y todo llegaba en un mes o dos, pero desde hace dos años no llega nada. Debo aclarar que sólo enviamos tarjetas (cumpleaños, navidad) o cartas, y no enviamos absolutamente nada más dentro de ellas, así que se nos hace extraño que todas no lleguen a su destino en Ecuador. Por otro lado, los envíos desde Ecuador a Inglaterra llegan sin problemas en alrededor de un mes.",
                    " ",
                    "La razón por la que esperé dos años es porque no se me había occurido preguntar aquí y además porque la última tarjeta tardó nueve meses en llegar, así que se puede decir que aún estaba esperándola. Al momento son entre cuatro o cinco cartas/tarjetas que no han sido entregadas.",

                    "La dirección en Ecuador está correcta y no ha cambiado. La correspondencia desde Inglaterra llegaba sin problemas como dije antes. He recibido envíos desde USA a la misma dirección sin problemas. Las cartas y tarjetas no han sido devueltas al remitente, y además han tenido las estampillas adecuadas para ser enviadas a Ecuador. De hecho la última vez fue chequeada por un empleado de la oficina de correos en Inglaterra y todo parecía estar correcto.",
                    " ",
                    "Por último, debajo de la dirección está el número de teléfono a donde la carta debería llegar y nadie de Correos del Ecuador ha llamado. Aunque la verdad no sé si hacen esto por cartas. Llamar o ir a Correos del Ecuador no sirve de nada porque preguntan por un código de tracking, y como estas eran cartas comunes, no hay ningún código y ellos no puede hacer nada al respecto.",

                    "Hi everyone. I am new in this subreddit. I am traveling in Ecuador right. I want to share an amazing dish that I found in Ecuador - Seco de pollo. It is a traditional Ecuadorian Chicken stew. It is so flavorful, soft and juicy- probably is the best chicken stew I have ever had. So I was so passional and trying to learn how to make it. I even took few cooking classes. Here is the recipe that I made. If any of you have advice on how to improve this recipe or other recommendation of Ecuadorian food, I will love to know. I did a lot of research for this and I don't speak Spanish. So if there is any mistake in this recipe, please let me know. I will love to improve.)",

I am not sure if this is special in Ecuador. If you can’t find this, I think you can try with chili oil. Because achiote has a sort of peppery aroma and It tastes a little bit earthy. Chili oil won’t be exactly the same but it should work fine. )",

                    "Stir the pot and make sure the Aji seco powder is evenly dissolved. Give it a taste to see if it needs more salt. Mine does so I add a little more. Total, I add about 2.5 tsp of salt here not including the salt that I rub the chicken with.",

                    "EN mi ultimo viaje yo compre un auto en Ecuador. Mi esposa esta haciendo los tramites de traspaso etc mientras yo estoy acá en USA. Pero ella no ha tenido un auto antes y yo no conozco los procesos en Ecuador.",
                    "Por lo que me dice hasta ahora, se hizo ya el proceso de venta y ya paso a ser nuestro, bueno, de ella ya que ella tiene cédula y yo todavía no. Ahora esta en el proceso de \"revision\" y matricula. Le hemos hecho algunos arreglos (dirección hidráulica, radiador)  pero ella esta muy preocupada que no va a pasar. Tenemos hasta Marzo 1 para completar, ella me dice que nos dan un mes desde la compra.",
                    "Me pueden dar información de este proceso de revision? Les doy un ejemplo : el coche tenia un escape de aceite hidráulico. Se le puso manguera nueva y ya no se sale. Pero le dicen que lave el auto por abajo porque se ve sucio y la pueden fallar.. ?? Lo llevo a ver el alineamiento y le dijeron que no se podía porque esta botando aceite. 1) no esta botando ya y 2) que tiene que ver eso con alineamiento? (Yo si soy semi-mecanico). Yo pienso que no lo querían hacer o al ella ser mujer se están aprovechando de ella.",
                    "Estoy considerando contactar la casa Jeep a ver si ellos lo pueden revisar y ayudarme a pasar la revision. Pero me siento que no entiendo el proceso. Si tienen un link a algo que explique esto con detalle se los agradezco.",

I like the flexibility and time of hiring a taxi, but dislike the cost.  I know I need to weigh out the pros and cons of both.",

If you're going on vacation, then I would suggest the bus. It's definitely stressful driving around Ecuador. They've made a lot of improvements to the highways, so the road itself isn't super dangerous. However, there are speed bumps, potential police check points and drivers who follow a different set of norms (passing while going around curves, for example). Hope this helps.",

                    "Te estoy dando una respuesta muy sesgada, pero entre mis amigas y conocidas (rango de edad 20 - 40) sí nos identificamos abiertamente como feministas.",
                    "Veo también que es muy fácil, como en el resto de Latinoamérica, que te traten de feminazi por otros hombres o por otras mujeres en general.",
                    "No hay demasiado avance, pero hay mujeres que se han definido como portavoces bastante elocuentes acá. Existen charlas o se comparte información, sobre todo en twitter, que es la red social que más uso.",
                    "Para darte un ejemplo, Palabralab ha dictado varios cursos de índole feminista. Se ha analizado, por ejemplo, El cuento de la criada, viendoa  fondo la parte social y el rol de la mujer en la sociedad. Y en la nuestra.",
                    "Eso no existe en Ecuador. Hace mucho tiempo se logro igualdad de derechos y oportunidades. Aca son muy pocas las mujeres que abiertamente se identifican como feministas, puesto que aca todavia conservamos un poco los roles tradicionales de hombre (proveedor) y mujer (mama).",
                    "Yo opino que el feminismo en Ecuador es algo que la mayoría de las personas lo ven como un movimiento de moda de mujeres quisquillosas en países del primer mundo,  por tal razón no es tomado en serio.",
                    "Eso no existe aqui, se practica mucho la igualdad.",
                    "El machismo está muy arraigado tanto en hombres como en mujeres.",
                    "Femenazis? No aún no! Pero las mujeres se hacen respetar y los hombres las apoyamos sin necesidad de ideologías extremistas.",

                    "So I'm traveling to Ecuador for a month for the first time come summer (round trip LAX to Quito), and definitely jumped the gun on a two-destination flight that worked well with my travel plans towards the end of my trip (Guayaquil>Galapagos>Quito the day before I fly back to LAX).  I booked this flight cheap which leaves me with 10 days on the Islands in late May-early June.",
                    "I'm definitely on a backpacking budget and booked the flights on impulse without really researching how expensive the Galapagos was.  I do not plan on taking a cruise unless I got an insanely good last-minute deal.  Can anyone with experience give me a rough estimate of what 10 Days on the Island would cost at it's cheapest minus airfare and entrance fee?  I was hoping to do the whole thing on around $500 (again minus airfare and entrance fee), is that at all doable?  If I was to double that budget, would that still not be enough? Thanks!",
                    "I should add that this flight only cost me $150 round trip, and if I have to eat it I will.",
                    "I just got back from Backpacking in the Galapagos last week with a friend. We stayed on Santa Cruz for 8 days and did some day trips from there.",
                    "We were able to stay at a hostel for about $10-15 per person, sharing a private room. Meals ranged from $5-12 dollars, but there are more expensive options.",
                    "What gets expensive are day trips. Snorkeling tours averaged $100-120 per trip. Diving was $160. And for example, a 7-8 hour tour only involved an hour of snorkeling max. So I didn't find it worth it compared to the free activities I did.",
                    "The best option for you might be island hopping and doing free activities on each of the major islands: San Cristobal, Santa Cruz, and Isabella. It's $30 for a one way ferry ticket.",
                    "We also found many, many cheaper last minute cruises. For example, there were several 6 day cruises for $1100. In retrospect, I wish I did a cruise because the day trips added up. But either way it's awesome.",
                    "Hope that helps!",
                    "Thanks for the response!  Definitely helps.  I'm still in the process of researching budget trips and I know the info is out there, but wanted to hear from someone firsthand.",
                    "From what I've read the majority of people recommend boat trips, but I still feel a backpacking trip will be worth it considering the price I paid for the flights.  Would the free activities you're referencing mostly just include hikes?  I would love to spend most days just hiking around and then maybe save a few days to spend a little extra on random adventures like snorkeling or diving.",
                    "My wife and I saved up for a bit before going to the Galapagos, so we did a cruise for some of the time and then stayed on both Santa Cruz and Isabella for a bit. The cruise had much better return on our money! We booked ours a week or two before it sailed (getting a good discount). If we had been able to wait til the day of, it could have been even cheaper (our schedules didn't allow this).",
                    "Once you get on the islands, you can and should go for last minute deals on cruises. You paying a fraction of the sticker price is still better for the company than having an empty spot.",
                    "Thanks for the insight, looking for a last minute cruise deal is definitely something I'm going to keep in mind! I still have a few months to save, and I have the opportunity to work as many hours as I'd like with my current job(s), so I might just try to increase my budget significantly for this trip.",
                    "If flights weren't so cheap I wouldn't be dead set on hitting Galapagos, but now that I have the opportunity it would be a shame to be on the islands and not get a full experience out of it.",
                    "Most of the free activities I did included hiking to a beach and swimming/snorkeling there, visiting the town sites, and hiking through lava tunnels. For instance, Tortuga Bay on Santa Cruz is simply gorgeous (one of the best in the world) and was about a 45-60 minute walk from Puerto Ayora. I also visited the Charles Darwin Research Center for free.",
                    "The challenge is that most of the areas and spots to see on the islands are a national park that are inaccessible on your own and/or cannot be accessed by land. So you end up needing a tour, usually by boat/cruise ship, to access those areas. For instance, I had planned to take a ferry to Isla Floreana, hire a water taxi or tour there to take us the short distance out to snorkel Devils Crown, but it's actually only accessible by cruise ship. Same with Isla Isabella. You can take a ferry over and stay in Puerto Villamil, do a few hikes close to town (including the volcano if it is open) and visit the beach, but most of the island is restricted. The amazing spots on the entire west coast, including the animals to see, are only accessible by boat.",
                    "So it does depend on what you want to do in the Galapagos. If you \"must\" see certain wildlife, your best chances for that might be a cruise ship. But if you just want to see some islands, enjoy the local towns, do a little bit of hiking, relax on the beach, then doing your own thing could be great.",
                    "In 10 days you could easily spend a few nights on each of the three major islands and find enough low cost or free activities to keep you busy and make a trip to the Galapagos more than worth it. San Cristobal is apparently great for wildlife, while Isabella is great for volcanic geography. Santa Cruz has the amazing beach and research center with the giant tortoises. Marine Iguanas are everywhere and sea lions, sea turtles, and rays are plentiful.",
                    "So to answer your question of whether $500 for 10 days is doable - it can be! It would be tight, as you would need to eat and stay inexpensively and spend most of your days doing free/self organized activities. Then I would recommend budgeting some of that for ferries to other islands ($30 for one way ticket). It was the organized day tours that are ridiculous.",
                    "It's definitely more expensive in the Galápagos than on the Ecuadorian mainland, but it can still be done independently for much cheaper than a cruise. Base yourself in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island, there is plenty to see and do there. For food, I went to Calle de los Quioscos every night for dinner. The restaurants put big tables out into the middle of the street and serve up fresh seafood and chicken for much cheaper than the restaurants on Charles Darwin Avenue.",
                    "Hola, ive heard galapagos is crazy expensive. Never made the trip so i cant say much more. Just keep in mind in ecuador everything is negotiableand dont be afraid to haggle. I live on the coast in salinas. Keep your rolex at home and dont be flashy and you will have more bargaining power",
                    "Hola!  It definitely looks that way, although hostels and food seem affordable so at least that aspect is doable.  Thank you for the advice, If I had a Rolex to leave at home I certainly would :)",
                    "I was there in June 2016 and I'll be returning this year with my son.  If you want some insight on last minute cruises this guy's blog gives pretty good insight.  Definitely try and get a cruise because that's the only way you can see a lot of the remote islands.  I didn't get a cruise the first go around because I REALLY wanted to visit Floreana (see crazy doc and baroness) and it wasn't a stop with the cruise I was offered.  You can do one/two day out and back trips, which is what I did, but the boat rides get to be very long.  I wish I had spent more time on Isabella.  That island is huge with plenty to do, relatively cheap and has the rare pink iguana.  Bring your own snorkeling gear and a wet suit (the water is colder than you may think).  You can walk out to the beach and see amazing things without even a tour to some remote place.  Bikes can be rented for $20 a day everywhere.  Hope this helps.  EDIT - Oh and bring 2 dollar bills.  They love'm down there."

Base yourself in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island, there is plenty to see and do there. For food, I went to Calle de los Quioscos every night for dinner. The restaurants put big tables out into the middle of the street and serve up fresh seafood and chicken for much cheaper than the restaurants on Charles Darwin Avenue.",

                    "Some time I considering Ecuador for the country when I will move to live.",
                    "For now, I read that is very friendly to strangers, and cost of living is low. But how low?",
                    "How much will I pay for a small apartment for 2 peoples, in middle areas? One room should be fine. Also, I'm a freelancer and I will need stable internet connection and account on some of Ecuador banks. Am allowed opening an account?",
                    "What works are easily available for women and how much is wage? I don't think my girlfriend diploma for 'business and management' will be recognized here, so she will look for a more casual type of jobs.",
                    "And my last question, how much is spread the English language? Or I will need to learn Spanish fast?",
                    "Technology (tv, laptop, electronics) and cars are expensive here due to import taxing, clothing is less expensive, food and living is relatively low but it depends of a lot of factors like in every other place (ubication, crime rates, busy street with market opportunities, etc) it also varies from city to city, more developed cities has higher appartment costs but if you manage to have an steady income you can endure it, Ecuador its also open to foreing investments and work labor generation, so if you plan to make jobs for others will be great.",
                    "You need 450 dollars monthly for rent, learn Spanish as fast as you can, you can eat for 8 dollars a day, minimum wage 380 dollars approx. All this info is valid for Quito, the country capital. Also you can open an account in any bank. That's all. Sorry for my bad english.",
                    "Your English is perfect tbh.",
                    "Thx!",
                    "You need a visa to be able to work here. To apply for residency with an investors visa, you need to make a 25k USD deposit. If you withdraw or cancel the policy, your visa will be invalid. This is essentially used as 'collateral'. You can also use housing as a basis for your visa. If you're considering a different type of residency visa, you'll have to look into its implied costs very, very seriously; it'll put a damper in the whole cost of living deal.",
                    "Minimum wage here is about 400USD/month. Everyone can open a savings around, but not a checkings account.",
                    "The costs of living depend which part of the country you're in. Do you want to live in the capital, a large city, the coast...",
                    "I can tell you from experience that finding work as a woman here can be very aggravating. Without speaking Spanish, your girlfriend's best bet would be to work for a company managed by expats.",
                    "On the coast, the vast majority of the people that I met could get by in English very passably and the same was true for any major tourist hotspot. In Cuenca, very few people I know can speak it.",
                    "If you don't speak Spanish, it is very difficult to live here: it's one of the factors that leads expats to go home after a few years.",
                    "You may want to consult with a lawyer or speak to an English-speaking accountant concerning taxation on freelance work. Money made outside of the country is not taxed on here. How this works for freelancers with their own companies abroad is something you might want to investigate.",
                    "Hi. For the last year I have been in the process to move there. So maybe some of my experiences will help. Note to Ecuatorians : I love your country and none of my comments should be taken with any disrespect intended.",
                    "I am originally from Puerto Rico, a USA citizen. But I speak Spanish from my native country. So this makes it much easier for me. You DO need to learn Spanish, as English speakers are not everywhere. I have only been to Quito so far, I would expect that more touristic destinations might have more English speakers, but if you plan to live there you will not be in a hotel so, yeah, learn Spanish. Re the local words, I have been to small very local restaurants where I can barely read the menu. A lot of food has local names that are not \"generic Spanish\" lets say. But my wife is from Ecuador so she translates. :-)",
                    "Cost. Again, I am in Quito. Cost varies as everywhere else. But in general : rents are MUCH lower than USA (3 Bedroom large house for $500 in the Valley),  utilities are super cheap (gas+elec+phone) don't add up to $100.. Internet is good, I have a 50 line for $75/mo. (work from home remote) and has been very reliable, which also helps with Netflix etc.. But then, a 1999 car was $10,500... ugh. Cars are expensive. Electronics not bad, a bit higher but not terrible. Food is the same at supermarket, lower at the local market. In general, anything that is labor intensive is cheap (gardener, carpenter, etc) while electronics, auto, other imports are expensive.",
                    "So, for example, we go grocery at SuperMaxi and do spend $200.. But the gardener does the whole acre of work for $45.. Recently had the car worked on. Here in the USA the parts are cheap and the labor is horrible. There, the parts are a bit expensive, but the labor (3 hrs) was $50.. :-)",
                    "Work : I am going with a remote job from the USA, which makes my income better than average there and work from home. But I have been looking for local work to see what is available. Average salarias are generally low, which matches cost of living. But then, to BUY a house or a CAR, I am not sure how people do it on the local salary! Yet you see newer cars everywhere, so go figure.",
                    "From my experience this last year, Ecuador is a wonderful place to start your own small business. There is a lot of opportunity. My wife is an elementary school teacher, but decided to stay home and does small businesses on the side.",
                    "Tip: Ecuadorians barter.  Almost every price you are quoted is open for discussion. :-)  In my first visit I found it kind of funny, and difficult for me as we don't negotiate prices much in the USA. But they do. For everything. One of the most common questions you will hear is \"cuanto es lo ultimo\" which is basically asking for the bottom price. It does make me smile when somebody asks for $5 and my mother in law starts negotiating.. :-)",
                    "Everybody has been very warm and welcoming. Quito is beautiful (in general, as cities go). And I think life is healthier there. You walk more, hills everywhere, taxi and bus a lot, fresh fruit and vegetables abound. My daughter traveled to Galapagos and consider it the best experience of her life.",
                    "Tip: Dealing with immigration (called Extranjeria) has been a nightmare. Every paper has to be notarized, apostille (look it up), then translated, and the translation has to be also notarized and apostilled. In the end, I have hired an immigration lawyer to help me through. As all other labor, lawyers are cheaper than in the USA. Depends on what visa/permit you plan to use. The consulate here in US (FL) has not been helpful at all.",
                    "Sorry this is so long. Life is complicated. :-)  All places have good and bad. All places can be cheap and/or expensive. Depends on lifestyle. I know some people get along there with under $500/mo.. But you can spend much more depending on lifestyle. Hope this helps.",
                    "I am not sure how people do it on the local salary!",
                    "Actually, those people who are buying probably work for a government. I've learned from the news that fucking road cop can gain as much as 2k. And if you're aware of the state of traffic in Ecuador, you can tell those guys are doing a shit job. And there are a lot of this kind of guys in Ecuadorian government. And the government itself is huge. About 60% of Ecuadorian middle class works for a government and this is catastrophe, if think about it. All these taxes, oil sales, credits from China went directly to support this mob of useless people doing shitty jobs.",
                    "I found that if you want to live in a first-world style in Quito, then cars and TVs and groceries and toiletries and restaurants and pubs are the same price or more than in America.",
                    "If you want to live like the Indigenous and shop in the markets, make all your own food, take the bus, you can live fairly cheaply.",
                    "You can hire someone to work for you for $20 a day. Labour is so cheap there, but consumer goods are very expensive. That disparity explains a bit why the crime rate is so high.",
                    "As everyone else mentioned, there are no jobs there for you and you need to speak Spanish (and learn a little Quechua, too).",
                    "You can hire",
                    "And if you do, do it unofficially, as they'll take out your guts, if you're stupid enough to sign some papers.",
                    "1 bedroom apartment anywhere from 250 to 900 depending on furnishings, location and such.",
                    "Yes, people are nice. No, don't expect to live like a European or American and spend less here. If you buy everything in the Supermarket, you will not be living cheaper than anywhere.",
                    "That being said, food is very cheap in markets if you buy what is in season, and there is plenty in season year round!",
                    "Basic meals are very cheap ($2.50) and moderately good dining is posible for just $25 for a couple.",
                    "So you can spend anywhere from 1 to 3 thousand a month to live nicely.",
                    "Yes, you can open an account, some banks have some stupid demands (like landline phone and recomendations from 2 friends with a landline phone etc) but just go to the banks that don't bother too much with that, like Banco de Guayaquil or Bolivariano (some of the bigger ones). Just bring your documents, one payment of water or electric bill (in your name or someone elses name) and $100 deposit (you can get this back inmediatly when you get your bank card 3 days later, except $9 for the card).",
                    "No Jobs Are Here. Except english teacher with some degree. You will make many hours and not a high pay if you want to do this profesionally (not as volunteer), and only in the biggest cities at big schools.",
                    "I REPEAT: No Jobs Here except maybe if you're fluent in spanish and have all the qualifications and don't ask for a lot of money.",
                    "Continuing on that: NOBODY here speaks English. Except for a select few, you can not expect anyone you meet to speak more than literally 2 words of english (my friend).",
                    "Putting that aside, starting your own business here is easy, cheap, hassle free and there are a lot of open markets here, especially in (national) tourism etc.",
                    "For a Visa, you either need to have a Degree, Basically any real degree, but the university has to be on their list. If it's not, you can pply to it to be added, but that's not so easy.",
                    "No Degree? The investment VISA is from $26.000 for a couple. You can invest in land, companies or in a CD. That CD carries upto 9% interest per year in USD!",
                    "If your girlfriend wants to ride on your VISA, you need to at least be registered partnership, ask a notary to court-translate any documents before you come, makes it a lot easier.",
                    "Learn Spanish.",
                    "Wow, that is a very good interest rate. I checked and even though the inflation rate is around 5% a 4-5 % return is very good.",
                    "I am really interested in relocating to Ecuador but need to work much more on my spanish. The whole pricing of vehicles is also pretty insane. I am wondering if I were to wait until I was had a pension or investment visa if it would make a difference importing a vehicle",
                    "No, even with full VISA and the ability to import 1 car, you need it to be a NEW car, and pay for the transport, customs clearing, warehousing, etc, etc.",
                    "That may STILL add up to be beneficial, but keep in mind the slightest problem may cause a delay. They will charge you CRAZY money for every day you are 'renting their storage'. So unless it's a (really rare or) pretty expensive (say a F150 that would be 50k here and is 28k in the US) NEW (max 1 year old) car, don't even think about it. And in the case of that example you will be saving maybe 5 to 10k, not 22k...",

Importation taxes are so ridiculously huge, you can't even imagine. You'll pay at least $40 for a package if you're not using national parcel service, doesn't matter of the package cost. And the national parcel service sucks in every possible way. It loses packages. And even if it doesn't, you are doomed to wait for months.

There is this concept of this associations that you can join, you start paying and after a (few?) months they will buy the car for you and finance low (3%), but I don't have a sense yet on how long you have to pay/wait to get the car.

                    "Due to y'all fellow redditors I was able to see most of the stuff that Quito had to offer in terms of history and culture. I was able to make a trip out to mitad del Mundo and the nearby crater. I went up to the elterefico and did a small trek ( could not complete it- y'all weren't kidding about altitude sickness and all). I did most of the old Quito and visited the newer parts of the city.",
                    "To people who are thinking about doing it in the future. Quito was absolutely lovely, and the people were awesome through and through. I did Airbnb and had wonderful hosts. Uber is actually really legit and dependable. Some drivers understood English and we had good conversations. If you wanna miss out on Uber then the public transport is actually quite nice as well. Google maps work like a charm.",
                    "I'm rambling all over the place, but I just wanted to thank y'all for the suggestions and urge other people to go down and visit Quito, as I will be again in the future.",
                    "Nice to hear your report. I agree Quito is a beautiful city.",
                    "This is super lovely",
                    "We move around on buses and taxis. Taxis are cheap. The issue I have with the buses is the locals know which one to take but they all look the same to me (or similar) and they are on a HURRY, so you either get on or not. I would say is not for the faint of heart.. :-)",
                    "Ubber is taking off big and you get very nice drivers and (sometimes) nice cars. And the prices compete with the taxis. Actually, during Christmas late at night there was no taxi to be found and ubber rescued us. One thing, there you pay the driver, not via ubber. At least the ones we took. Ubber gives you an estimated price which drivers stick to (mostly). A very sweet one admitted it was his first fair, was not sure how to use it, got a bit lost, and we ended up negotiating (get used to this, you do this a lot) for $5. ;-)",
                    "Also, note, Quito streets are either up or down hill. There is no flat. So keep that and elevation in mind.",
                    "Can't wait to visit the coast.",

When I go to the airport I talk to the taxi club near my house and always find a driver willing to take me for $20 off the meter. Note that the airport is quite outside the city and is a long ride. I usually have family pick me up when I arrive but the taxi will be by the meter, or you can talk to them for a fixed price to a certain destination.",

                    "I'm a a nice condo on the beach, south of Manta. Love it here. But.....there are no smoke or C02 detectors here anywhere in the apartment. They blankets are airline blankets. They don't cover me up entirely. (I'm serious - they have the names stamped right on them). The grounds are covered in garbage. This is supposed to be a high end condo I'm renting. Granite counter tops are lovely but WTF is with no smoke detector or C02 when there's a gas stove!? Also, one of the florescent bulbs was flashing rhythmically this morning. Both the switches for it were off. Is this some kind of alarm?",
                    "Rented a condo in San Clemente a couple of months ago and it was nice. Nice sheets/blankets. Your blankets are not normal. The grounds of condos I rented were pretty nice I don't remember much garbage but once you left the walls the streets and the city had a lot of garbage on the ground.",
                    "Smoke detectors and CO2 detectors don't seem to be big here. One reason is that the houses are typically all concrete so house fires aren't as common as in the states. I think they are also imported making them more expensive and that makes them a lower priority so supply is kind of limited.",
                    "Yes, it's normal. For the grounds to be dirty and non well-maintained. They mostly only hire security staff and those don't care. Local staff has to be supervised to make sure they actually pick up trash, and your neighbours might just throw something on the floor thinking the staff will clean it. Most probably not 1 trashcan anywhere in the public areas, which doesn't help.",
                    "When building my place 3 years ago, I had to import my own detectors. And while now I can find smoke detectors in all supermarkets, I have never seen a CO2 for sale anywhere.",
                    "The sheets are a joke of course, but I imagine they have some thin sheets on the bed and the airline ones are 'extra'. Since at the coast it's normal to only provide 1 thin sheet.",
                    "No, that is not an alarm but a cheap switch that has malfunctioned.",
                    "You can't yet expect even the high end condos to be well-made. Thin walls, faulty electric, cheapest water pump, cheap paint and cheap doors and windows with just 1 layer of glass, thin ceilings (with lowered ceilings to cover up the fact they are not even plastered and the tubing just goes underneath.",
                    "Which is why I'm considering building a small condo building here myself, since it's easy to sell good quality here, even the locals now prefer something build by a European or American...",
                    "Thank you. It's helpful to know what is normal and what is not. Sounds like this is usual! The condo is lovely and it's spotless. But, yes, it's obvious it's poorly constructed. I don't care so much. It's still got no snow!",
                    "hahahaha, I think I'll go to the mountains one of these days, want to see some snow, been so long!",
                    "Tbf, one layer of glass in the windows is common. I haven't seen windows with two. Not even in the highlands",
                    "Being common doesn't make it any better... It's a real money safer in cold and in hot weather...",
                    "I haven't said it's bad, it's just common to not have double layer.",
                    "Never been to Manta but that doesn't sound normal from the other places I've been to (both at the coast and in the mountains). Pretty much all the places I've been to over the last year and a half have been clean with appropriate bedding. I think the reason for the carbon monoxide detectors (or lack thereof) is because there's no mainline gas, it's all from bottles, so the risk is mitigated.",
                    "The condo itself is spotless and it has everything. It Is very nice.",
                    "Its not a normal situation. I have lived in manta and other cities. The only thing you describe as being normal is the detectors thing. There is a law for this but its not really enforced or checked upon that much unless you are in a major city (manta is not). All the other things you specify can be atributed to a lousy owner of the building. THIS IS NOT NORMAL HERE.",
                    "If you are airbnb-ing it I wouldn’t be surprised, not because it is Ecuador but usually people in small poor cities like Manta can be very cheap. Especially people in the coastal region are very carefree. If you can afford to tour around South America  if is understandable how detectors would seem so basic and you wouldn’t think of putting airline sheets on your beds. Different people in more wealthy neighborhoods wouldn’t be in these conditions either.",
                    "Try to take the state of the country in mind too, the people in those regions are suffering a major recession because of flooding and earthquakes. They don’t have much surplus money to spend.",
                    "One other thing is that fires in houses are not really common because of how houses are built in Ecuador. Concrete being very cheap and most houses not having too much wood to worry about fire.",
                    "Lastly, I believe that even in the US in the stray neighborhoods you could find plenty of examples like these. If you went to one of those red areas I wouldn’t be surprised if the streets were not the cleanest or houses didn’t adhere to all the safety costs",
                    "sighs It is all a matter of perspective, your eyes are not seeing the absolute reality of our country and your experiences don’t represent the norm for yours...",
                    "I  get all that, but the owner of the condo is American. He knows about smoke detectors and C02 detectors and decent blankets. Also, this is not a cheap place to stay. It's as much a decent hotel in Quito. I've travelled extensively in Europe, the US and some in Central America. The garbage is astounding. I don't know why the owner of the building doesn't give the 'security guard' a box of trash bags and tell him to pick up the trash. That would be a good idea.",
                    "The guard is from a security company and will absolutely NOT care about any trash. Most probably, it's (partly) his!",
                    "Lol! Even more, if the dude is American why are you asking about “is it normal in Ecuador”? Case and point, he is being a dick and simply ripping you off, don’t drag the whole country into it.",
                    "Unlike US buildings the walls are not made out paper. Hahaha",
                    "Where exactly in Manta are you? You can file a complain to the city about garbage filled lots..i live in Manta as well..dirty streets/lots is rare in high end neighborhoods...",
                    "The blanket things are not normal, but the lack off smoke detector and c02 are pretty usual.",
                    "As for the florescent bulbs flashing, I bet they need to be changed, so it's nhot an alarm or anything.",
                    "Also, if you're in Manta you should ckeck out Santa Marianita. It's lovely out there.",
                    "I'm IN Santa Marianita! Love it here! The property manager and some others have said it's because there is LED's in the switches and the electrical system is not up to NA standards. Oh well. I'm still happily beside the ocean and it's wonderful!",
                    "I think you're talking about Charly Aulestia. LOL. I've been there.",
                    "Nope, different condo.",
                    "If you're looking for a smoke detector, stay in (or go to) paranoid America. I find them to just be an annoyance.",
                    "A word of caution. Please be extra careful with the gas stove. In most countries odor is added to natural gas and propane or LPG.  This not the case here in Ecuador. You can leave a burner on or have a leak and you will never know until it is too late. If it is connected to a gas cylinder it is a good idea to turn off the regulator when not in use. Also Ecuador has a lot of variety as you may have already experienced. Some places are nicer that others. While many communities seem to give little thought to throwing garbage on the ground, others take pride in their town.",
                    "Thank you. I am scared of the gas so am leaving the balcony door open a bit. The stove wouldn't come on and the building manager just sprayed it with WD40. It's weird about the beach. There are garbage cans and people are using them, but the empty lots on each side are disgusting with trash. I'm tempted to clean it up and leave the trash at the can by the condo and send the owner a photo and tell him I did this.",
                    "Not true about the gas, it has sulfuric odor.  Co2 or fire detectors are not mandatory in houses, Which is why you don't see them, only on office buildings. Tbh it seems that while you may be charged high end prices the place you are at it's low end.  Don't be impressed about counters... A granite slab here can go as low as 80 bucks 120 cut and installed .  You should look over other options.  Blankets should have tipped you of... Most coastal cities only give you sheets, specially if no air conditioner is installed but an airline blanket its just the renter saving a buck instead of providing real blankets.   Very sorry you are being scammed, from what you described I wouldn't pay more than 250 a month."

This not the case here in Ecuador. You can leave a burner on or have a leak and you will never know until it is too late. If it is connected to a gas cylinder it is a good idea to turn off the regulator when not in use. Also Ecuador has a lot of variety as you may have already experienced. Some places are nicer that others. While many communities seem to give little thought to throwing garbage on the ground, others take pride in their town.",

Tbh it seems that while you may be charged high end prices the place you are at it's low end.  Don't be impressed about counters... A granite slab here can go as low as 80 bucks 120 cut and installed .  You should look over other options.  Blankets should have tipped you of... Most coastal cities only give you sheets, specially if no air conditioner is installed but an airline blanket its just the renter saving a buck instead of providing real blankets.

I speak english, my wife and kids are bilingual in french and english, wife has some small amount of Spanish, enough to barely be understood.  Largely we are an active family, spending a lot of time outdoors and regularly hike for 5-7 miles at a time with the kids.  We are not terribly fussy and like a little adventure. We are looking for suggestion on how to best fill in the agenda in a way that would be fun for us and the kids.  We like to keep things loose with probably no more than 2 big items in a day.  We appreciate value in travel, but we are not on a budget.",

Maybe something with access to a pool and hot tub for the kids.  From there we would do the telefriqo, museums and markets.  Are there any good places where the kids and be kids?",
                    "Maybe then we could rent a car and head out to see some mountains and jungle for 3-4 days.  Preferably, we would change locale a time or two.  I wonder what you all would suggest for this portion of the trip?  Should things be booked in advance?  Rent a car or rely on other means?",

The 3-kilometre (2 mi)-wide caldera was formed by the collapse of this dacite volcano following a catastrophic VEI-6 eruption about 800 years ago, which produced pyroclastic flows and lahars that reached the Pacific Ocean, and spread an airborne deposit of volcanic ash throughout the northern Andes. This last eruption followed a dormancy period of 14,000 years and is known as the 1280 Plinian eruption. The fourth (of seven) eruptive phase was phreatomagmatic, indicating that a Crater lake was already present at that time.",

                    "I'd say I like more the ones in the provinces of Manabi or Santa Elena. I think they are 1-3 hours further  by car from Quito than the ones in Esmeraldas. The view by driving can be nice too if you go to those.",
                    "I'd really recommend visiting Cotopaxi and Mindo. Cotopaxi, one of highest active volcanoes in the world. For roughly $50 per adult (No idea for kids) you can do a day trip from Quito, lunch included. You'll be able to get past the base camp, but won't be allowed to summit. For an extra $10 you can hire bikes to down the mountain. Mindo is a cloud forest, where you can see butterflies and hummingbirds. I didn't go to Mindo, but everyone raves about it. Having already seen hummingbirds in Cotopaxi, I'd say they alone would be worth the trip."

It's adventurous and the kids will love it. They are located in Tena. Also, you should visit the quilotoa, beautiful place. You should also go to the center of the world-* la mitad del mundo*-  you can also try \"El museo del agua\". But I definitely think that if you go, and you have a chance of renting a car, you should travel to the Amazon. There are plenty of natural waterfalls (El pailon del diablo) that will take your breath away. The huge mountains, and vegetation. It will also be warm there. Natural pools of water coming from the mountains... Enjoy your travel ;)",

                    "I will be taking a trip to Ecuador this spring.  I see there are a few trips from Guayaquil to Banos by bus.  It's hard to actually find the different bus stations and schedules, but this is all from travelers' blogs.  Does anyone know of an updated schedule or bus companies that do this trip?  I'd prefer not to do an over night trip.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "Here in Ecuador we are just risky motherf**rs. We just go to the terminal and look for the bus and Shchedule, right there, as the men we are. Hahaha. And Also because technology is bullshit.",
                    "http://ttg.ec this is the website for el terminal terrestre de Guayaquil . Here you can see the schedule of  buses going from Guayaquil to any where in the country.",
                    "That is a great resource, but if you can’t find what you are looking for you should go to some sort of travel agency. We have not gotten into the whole “have everything online” trend yet, thus I apologize. People usually just go to the physical place or call.",
                    "Thank you very much for your input!  I've noticed that it's not all online, but I also don't speak Spanish so I maybe I was missing something.  From the website above, I'm having a hard time finding the transfer.",
                    "Do you know what the frequency is for the buses from Guayaquil to Banos?",
                    "You are right, the bus schedule might not be complete, also another thing to consider is that Baños is pretty far away from Guayaquil, I looked it up for you and there is only one bus going there at 4:00AM (yes I know).",
                    "Are you traveling alone? If you don’t have a interpreter of some sorts I would thread carefully through my country, in such small towns like Baños I don’t think you would find too many English proficient people that could say past “Good Morning”. If you find it hard to use this website, I am worried that you couldn’t manage yourself in such a rural city.",
                    "Also, the further away you go from the urban areas and more into the slums and villages, people are going to realize you are a naive foreigner and might take advantage of you, especially if you are very obviously American looking... (be alert and stay skeptical) If you carry iPhones or expensive cameras, always be aware of where they are and keep them close, I couldn’t tell you how many compilations are there on Youtube of American girls taking a selfie in a in the middle of a random street and it getting snatched by a dude on a bike.",
                    "I apologize for all this, but I also urge you to keep in mind that these people by far do not represent us whole. But all countries have their version of “white trash”. It has some of the most lovely places to visit and many warm hearted people who love visitors. However, I did want to want you about some of the bad apples who hope you don’t find.",

                    "I am considering spending time along the coast and maybe later fly back to Quito and from there do an Amazon tour or day tours else where.  There are too many option, and I am going crazy trying to decide what to do!",

                    "Hola! I'm a Canadian who will be in Quito on Feb 10 and flying out at 5am on the 12th. Will I experience any travel disruptions? What's this water balloon/foam stuff I'm hearing about! Sounds like a blast!",
                    "Hey, I am sure that you won't experience any travel disruption , but what are you writing about is called carnaval here and yeah in some parts of Ecuador it is very intense , I am from guayaquil but I think that in Quito is way more intense than here.",
                    "Basically lots of people throw water to any people ( with water balloons, a hose, buckets, etc)on the streets, sometimes also foam and even eggs! So if you like that , then yeah have fun but if you want to go to a meeting like well dressed be very careful.",
                    "Other than that is very fun lots of people go to the beach, eat a lot of sea food and party a lot",
                    "It sounds like tons of fun, except for the eggs. I've very, very allergic to eggs. As in anaphylactic shock allergic. I'm only there Friday and Saturday. Damn. I was hoping to get foamed!",
                    "Yeah, it has to do with the area or neighborhood. I only ever played with my schoolmates and family. For example the only time I've played with strangers was years ago when going through some town travelling, the kids would throw water at our car and we would shoot foam at them whenever we could open the windows, it's fun little memory of mine.",
                    "If you're the ex president then fear the eggs otherwise carry an extra towel because strangers will likely throw water/foam to you (in crowded places, or walking down the street, you never know tbh)",
                    "Am not the ex-president. Thanks!  I'm looking forward to this!",
                    "Eggs tend to be an issue at parties and events with tons of people. Nowadays it’s getting harder to even throw water at people because of new laws and regulations.",
                    "Ah! Thx!",
                    "Don’t worry, if you are traveling during those times, it is very rare for someone to ambush you with water or foam. It is a tradition you organize with friends or family.  Maybe if you travel to coastal areas it can get a little crowded because people go to the beaches but you should be fine, especially in tourist places people are usually respectful  and wont bother you.",
                    "I'm currently on the coast in Santa Marianeta. Sounds like fun, except for the egging and other poster mentioned.  I have a severe, life threatening allergy to eggs.",

                    "¿Hay ecuatorianos aqui? He escuchado que en Ecuador se desarolla el turismo gay. ¿Como los ecuatorianos ven a la comunidad LGBT en su pais? ¿Se acepta o no tanto?",
                    "Si soy ecuatoriana",
                    "It's true that in the last ten years or so there has been a bigger acceptance towards gays and lesbians. But there is still so much to do, unfortunately this is a very catholic society and many people are still openly against homosexuality. Some months ago, some parents went out to protest when they found out that in schools they wanted to expand their curriculum on sex Ed to include gender topics. They claimed that they were teaching children to be gay or lesbian and that the integrity of family was being attacked.",
                    "Just to give you another example, there is a derogatory term in Spanish known as maricon, the equivalent to English is faggot and its still thrown around as an insult every day even in political rallies to talk about the candidates the crowd is against, referring to them as maricones, as a way of saying I'm definitely not one of them! Other people on the thread already mentioned some good points about there being gay bars in quito, which is true, there is a bigger LGBT scene here but don't let that trick you into thinking that they're fully accepted in the community. I volunteered at fundación ecuatoriana equidad in quito. They have some amazing workshops and they make it their goal to teach anyone interested about gender, STDs or HIV/AIDS. I learned there that currently the most discriminated group throughout the country are transsexuals. We've got a long way to go clearly but I hope that narrow minded  Ecuadorians realize soon that you don't have to be gay, lesbian etc to fight for the rights that others deserve.",

                    "Well, I don't have children but if I were, I would definitely against all kind of \"gender topics\" washed into heads of children. There is much more important stuff to learn. Math for example. Ecuador seems have problem with that.",
                    "El problema es que los temas de genero tienen sus origenes en el Marxismo/Comunismo, y fueron creados con el proposito de corromper la mente de la juventud haciendoles creer que hay mas de 2 generos, y que ellos pueden escojer que genero tener.",
                    "No tengo hijos tampoco, y si los tuviera, tambien me opusiera al lavado de cerebro que les quieren hacer a los jovenes implantando ideas marxistas.",
                    "Marx talked about gender issues and mainly how the capitalist system, therefore an exploitative system managed to control the working class only for the benefit of the rich. He talked about women being part of that marginalized and therefore exploited  group. But I don't want to go into the politics.",
                    "All I'll say is gender is a social construction created by society, and it refers to how a person chooses to identify themselves and their own sexual preferences, it is absolutely personal and no one should get to dictate how one person identifies him or herself in relation to their gender. There is no indoctrination or brainwashing of young people when it comes to gender because it simply explains to children that there is something outside of what used to be considered as \"normal\", there are many options outside of being heterosexual and kids should have the right to know about the different types of gender that exist. No one is forcing anyone to become gay or lesbian.",
                    "Just my two cents",
                    "they don’t accept gay people within ecuadorian society. they’re working on it though. if you’re a tourist you won’t be the first and they won’t mind you, just don’t be to public with affection.",
                    "te recomiendo busques la pagina web de fundacion ecuatoriana equidad. En todo el Ecuador esta bastante aceptada la cosa. Yo he participado en varias marchas durante los ultimos anios. Hay mas bares gay en Quito que en partes de EEUU. Guayaquil tiene bares hasta las 4 de la manana",
                    "Depende de la ciudad en donde estés. Personalmente soy bisexual y casi todos en mi vida saben, excepto mi familia y en mi trabajo, que entiendo son lugares medio comunes para ocultarlo.",
                    "Normalmente la gente de mi edad (o al menos el círculo en donde me desarrollo) suele ser super chill about it. El problema suele venir con gente mayor, que suele ser mucho más cerrada o tener estereotipos mucho más marcados respecto a la comunidad GLBTI.",

That's like an hour bus ride from the city. You should also walk around the colonial part of Quito, and go to \"telefériqo\" but this last one is pretty high (I usually need my inhaler there and I'm a local). The food really depends on your budget and on whether you want to try typical dishes, but anyway it should be really easy to find. The language thing might be an issue since at least 90% of the people here don't speak a word of English or speak very basic English. So you might want to have a pocket dictionary, travel guide, translating thingy with you. Good luck!",

It seems like there is a lot to do in Ecuador, but from what I'm reading, people are saying not to rent a car? So I'm trying to figure out the best to get around.",
                    "Taxis, yes. Depends on your comfort, time, and money situation. We are budget traveling and have time to waste on buses. The Ecovia bus line in Quito is $0.25 a ride and they run north/south but get super packed during prime commute hours, and you need to be vigilant about pickpocketing and protecting your bag. Keep your backpack in front of you and cell and wallet in the bag or in zippered pocket.",
                    "Renting a car IN Quito is a bad idea, no matter your budget, as parking is tough to find in the popular spots. Taxis are easy and everywhere as long as a couple  $2 or $3 rides per day is Ok for your budget. A taxi should be about $3-$4 to get from la Carolina park (think Central Park but smaller) in New Quito, to the historical center of Old Quito. Same to the bottom of the Teleferiquo gondola.",
                    "You can hire Cotopaxi day tours out of Quito, that will provide private transport, a guide, snacks, and lunch for ~$60ish. You can book this when you arrive, and you might want to watch the weather for a clear day. A Cotopaxi day trip involves being drivien to the parking lot at 4,800m (15,600 feet) then hiking up 200m (650 feet) to the refugio, which is a lodge/cabin where summiteers sleep the night before attempting the climb, starting at midnight, to the summit. The hike takes an hour even though it’s not far, because the air is so thin. Bring layers, base (wool or synthetic), mid layer (fleece or down), and shell for rain/wind. Also a buff for covering your face, gloves, sunglasses and sun screen. Sorry if you know all that already ;).",
                    "You cannot do Cotopaxi on your own without a guide, so whether you bus to the park or rent a car, get a guide before entering for $35 or $40, at the guides for hire place on the road towards the entrance. If you happen to stay in Latacunga, you can get the same Cotopaxi day tour for $30-$40, which we did since we were already there for the Quilotoa Loop. A Cotopaxi summit climb will cost $225 with 2 sign ups and a minimum of $350 as a solo sign up. This is tough and at best conditions a 50/50 chance if you dedicate some time at altitude in advance to get acclimated (weeks) and are in good shape. If you’re doing this, then do a lot more reading on it.",
                    "Back to transport, we use buses to get around everywhere. From Quito, you need to get to the Quitumbe bus station in the south of the city, where you can find buses to almost everywhere in the country. Popular spots are Baños (2hr), Tena (3hr), Cuenca (9 hr), and the coast (which we haven’t been to yet). It’s a little more than a $1 per hour to give an idea on pricing. We put our large backpacks underneath the bus and keep our day packs, with our laptops, cameras, passports and valuables, on our laps for the bus ride.",
                    "We are hostel traveling, so car rental would be problematic if staying in hostels as there is not often protected parking. I’d imagine you’d be staying at actual hotels and paying for parking. In general, if city traveling is your thing, then a car is a hassle. If you’re going to the coast, then it would be more feasible to rent a car so you can save time you can get to harder to reach places. There are also more expensive, but faster, private transport services that you can find in between most cities. $20 p/p Quito to Tena for instance, if you prefer more private and secure transport.",
                    "I’m typing this from Cuenca right now, and I gotta day this is a really nice city. It’s cleaner and better preserved then old Quito.",

                    "Also, as a NorCal home brewer, that misses his craft beer, I’d recommend Bandido Brewing near Old Quito, if you want some tasty craft brews and brewpub style grub. It’s not authentic Ecuadorian at all, but for a moment I felt like I was back home when I visited.",

I live in Quito so as an insider this is what I can recommend: you should definitely go to the \"Mitad del Mundo\" monument, a museum in the middle of the world. That's like an hour bus ride from the city. You should also walk around the colonial part of Quito, and go to \"telefériqo\" but this last one is pretty high (I usually need my inhaler there and I'm a local). The food really depends on your budget and on whether you want to try typical dishes, but anyway it should be really easy to find. The language thing might be an issue since at least 90% of the people here don't speak a word of English or speak very basic English. So you might want to have a pocket dictionary, travel guide, translating thingy with you. Good luck!",

                    "This is a difficult one to answer. Yes, I would assume that most miss some of the main stream aspects that you can find in Europe, both in daily life and on a larger scale. With that said though, most students travel to Denmark or other European countries to study, and generally stay there for 3-7 years, after which they move back home. While I will never move home, the people who do so miss the Faroese lifestyle, and are content with living there.  ",

                    "Most restaurants that you will find will have standard food, which you'll find in most Scandinavian restaurants. However, in Tórshavn you'll find restaurants that focus on faroese food, such as Barbara (fish restaurant), Áarstova (lamb and seafood), etika (sushi) and Ræst (which advertise \"a fermented gourmet experience\"). On top of this we have the world famous Koks restaurant, which I believe still hold a Michelin star. The usual faroese diet is much like the scandinavian, however you'll also see a lot of fish on the table, especially outside of Tórshavn. This often related to most families having fishermen, which can supply a lot of high quality fresh fish.",

Our biggest mountain is only 882m (a Canadian I was showing around described it as a foothill) and while it is beautiful on a good day, it doesn't have the same epic scale that New Zealand has.",

                    "So I'm a bit confused as to what a trip to Mykines requires. 1)  How well in advance do I have to book tickets for the ferry/helicopter? and where can I book? I'm a bit worried about booking and then not being able to go, because of weather 2)  I'm a little confused about this guide situation, I know there's an entrance fee, I've read some stuff about how having a guide is required, but others have said that you can just walk around on the set path. How much does a guide typically cost? Is there a way to circumvent that rule. 3) Would it be better to stay overnight instead of returning on the same day? Also I know there's a few hostels in the area, do these also require booking well in advance? 4) Also biggest question, are the Mykines worth it? I know this is the most common destination but I have no i idea if it's worth the hype.",
                    "We visited the island a couple weeks ago so I can clarify a couple of points for you.",
                    "If your only a few people you can generally book the ferry a few days out, but be as early as possible. Book on mykines.fo and helicopter on the atlantic airways site (probably further in advance)",
                    "You don't need a guide, but do need to pay the fee on hiking.fo. There is guides there who will check this as you leave the town.",
                    "We came both ways by ferry on the same day and this was plenty of time to walk to the lighthouse and explore the town with lots of stops. There is a very small hostel + guesthouse so if you are staying I would imagine these need to be booked in advance.",
                    "Absolutely, we had great weather and it was the highlight of the trip",
                    "Helicopter can only be booked one-way, unless you fly out a different day than the way in! So for a daytrip, use the ferry or combine ferry+heli. Especially now, chances are 9/10 that all helicopter seats are booked.",
                    "Mykines is stunning for a good reason. Like Venice, it is superb, but the steady supply of tourists (of which many, sadly, with little understanding of wildlife) does undermine it a little. However, if you take an overnight stay, the island is all yours after the ferry heads back to civilisation.",
                    "Imho, the village alone is worth the trip, but the Holmurin makes it incredible. I know Faroese people who go there as well once in a while, as even for them it is somehwat otherworldly.",
                    "A guided tour to Mykines typically cost between 1200-1500 DKK. You can check out guided tours to Mykines on Guide to Faroe Islands."

                    "I'm planning a 9-10 day solo trip in Faroe Islands in August and I'd like to sleep at the campsites and do some hikes. However, on all the websites I've checked so far, one of the hiking rules mentioned is to never hike on your own. While I understand that it's a general advice everywhere in the world, is there anything specific about hiking conditions in Faroes that could make it more dangerous? I suspect part of the problem is the weather, mostly the wind I guess? Which might be dangerous on exposed trails. I'll add that I'm not a newbie to hiking, I also have some experience in hiking in Iceland, which I imagine might be somehow similar.",
                    "Sudden thick fog is an issue. If this happens, sit down and call 112. No hiking expert, so maybe someone can elaborate further. One very good practice, if you go alone, is telling people “I’m going hiking here, I’ll be back at X pm, if not, call for help”",
                    "Thank you for your answer! Your advice to tell somebody about my itinerary is a good one. The problem with it is that I plan to move between the campsites and therefore won't come back to the same place most of the time.",
                    "Ideally go sit by a cairn (varði in Faroese). These will be dotted all along any remotely established hiking route and will make you easier to find if that becomes necessary.",
                    "There aren’t that many camp sites on the Faroes. Not that you’re not getting 9-10 days of hiking done, but pitching a tent on someones property can lead to shitty experiences. As a rule, you should get the owners permission beforehand. This is one of the few cases where I don’t advice “it’s easier getting forgiveness than permission”. 95% of the landowners will give you permission.",
                    "Thank you, I will keep that in mind. I will try to stick to the designated camp sites.",
                    "Www.camping.fo lists all campsites.",
                    "Some hikes can be dealt with on your own, but those aren't generally the ones you've come for or see in the pictures. Other hikes are ok because so many others do it as well so you will never be completely alone.",
                    "It's not only the weather, it's also the mossy terrain that is full of holes and slippery rocks. Faroese terrain is full of them. It frequently happens that a tourist (and locals too) sprains an acle or worse. In those situations you're completely on your own and perhaps not even visible for the rescue helicopter.",

                    "Some old virtually disused roads are also good and safe hiking grounds, such as to Múli (requires back-tracking), Hvannasund-Viðareiði and Lopra-Sumba. Also nice: the unused road to abandoned Søltuvík, Sandoy. Np traffic here beyond the odd sheep owner. Also Gjógv-Funningur/Eiði doesn't get too much traffic, not annoying at least.",
                    "In general, however, I think you can meet likeminded hikers as in most hostels and camp sites, to team up with for the day.",
                    "Some hikes really, really require company if you are a normal person caring about safety. Those are obviously hikes that pass mountain ridges, with a lot of metres up and down, often through unconnected valleys with poor cellphone reach where only sheep come.",
                    "Yeah the Faroes are wet and slippery. It's possible to get badly hurt by falling, and calling for help is hard if you're alone, have broken or sprained something, and there's bad cell phone connection. Or worse you could have hit your head and be alone and unconscious in the mountains.",
                    "There are many people who have just up and vanished in the Faroese mountains.",
                    "So you're taking some pretty serious chances by going alone on routes that are not frequently traveled or that are not visible from villages or roads.",
                    "Thank you very much, this is very informative and exhaustive. I will take all your advice into account and reconsider my plans, maybe I will reduce the hiking part and do more sightseeing.",
                    "/u/kalsoy might disagree with me, but if you are an experienced hiker most of the trails will be of no issue (weather permitting). I wouldn't tell you to reconsider your plans, rather have multiple ideas/itineraries in place for any given day just in case bad weather is present. I would argue the ones shown in the most well-known pictures can absolutely be done alone.",
                    "IF you are careful, have common sense, and have hiked many times before, I don't think many hikes are off the table. The well-known ones are doable. While he put a question mark on Nolsoy, I have hiked that one and would say it is much simpler than the main trail on Kalsoy. One constant worry is the edges of the islands, the cliffs. As a hiker/backpacker myself, I implore you to not \"reduce\" the hiking part unless absolutely necessary.",
                    "Fyi, I will be back in August of this year, the 6th to the 15th. Feel free to come on some hikes with me, I will probably (possibly?) be doing the long one around the island of Vagar.",
                    "Thank you very much for your advice and all the information, as well as your kind offer. I will consider my plans and let you know (tbh I’m not even sure about my travel dates yet.)",
                    "So as usual, the matter boils down to personal preparation and experience. It seems that I’ll still have to do some more research to decide which trails I am suitable for. But since it’s gonna be my first time in Faroe Islands, I actually don’t mind doing less hiking than I initially intended and more of seeing the towns and villages, as long as I still get to walk a couple of nice trails with interesting views. But I surely won’t push it alone on any difficult hikes or in dubious weather."

Otherwise, the weather is so unpredictable there that I’d say hiking probably isn’t recommended because you could get stranded quickly by fog, snow, or rain.

We are sleeping in a tent and have been in contact with the tourist centre in Klaksvík regarding tent sites. They responded that no tent site was available those nights.",

                    "To my knowledge, there aren't a lot of places to set up a tent, unless it's on a private property. People can be pretty generous, though, so you could ask around.",
                    "I'd maybe try asking the schools in Klaksvík to see if you could set up by their fields. If you explain your situation there's a chance they might allow it.",

                    "Hi I was attempting to book a day trip to mykines but saw that it was nessicary to buy a ticket from hiking.fo so I bought one but failed to realize that there are no helicopter return flights on tuesdays. Is it possible to return the tickets I got from hiking.fo or should we take the risk with coming back from mykines by ferry",
                    "I think you have to buy a ticket for the ferry beforehand. You can buy a ticket at www.mykines.fo",
                    "Well, don’t take the risk of returning by ferry if you have something to do or some other place to be the next day.",
                    "If you can rearrange things somehow, book a ferry out to Mykines and a heli for the return trip. The Faroese make it a pain to get to & from this popular little island.",
                    "That's why I was wondering if it was possible to return the pass I got from hiking.fo since that was for specific days",
                    "The deal with hiking.fo and tours on Mykines is brand new, so I wouldn't be surprised if you are the first one to return the pass. Just contact them and ask.",
                    "Thank you I will try and contact them",
                    "I was able to get a refund on my pass when I couldn’t use it, so, probably.",
                    "The Faroese government pays 90% of your helicopter fare, you can hardly call that \"making it a pain\". (Try rowing in an open boat.)",
                    "I don’t mean to offend you, but cost isn’t the issue. The problem is availability. They could pay 100%, but it won’t help you if you’re a tourist stranded on the island for the weekend.",
                    "A bigger port on Mykines or some breakwaters might help the situation, but I obviously have no idea of the viability of a project like that.",
                    "The Faroese make it a pain to get to & from this popular little island.",
                    "Which is exactly the way it should be.  Travelers who have the drive and resources to get to that popular little island are rewarded with an amazing visit.  That should not change in the name of mass tourism.",
                    "It’s also about being lucky, isn’t it? The weather has to be on your side, otherwise your travel plans can get totally out of whack.",
                    "But if your view is that the tourism industry should be kept small, that’s fine. You’ve got to keep tourism from getting out of hand at the very least. But then there seems to be an honestly problem, right? “Come visit the Faroes, but only if you’re wealthy, driven, and have a very flexible travel schedule!”",
                    "“Come visit the Faroes, but only if you’re wealthy, driven, and have a very flexible travel schedule!”",
                    "Yes, actually.  Well, 2/3 of it anyway.  Let's break it down.",
                    "Wealthy: One hardly has to be \"wealthy\" to visit the Faroe Islands.  There are many places on earth that require wealth in order to visit but the Faroes is not one of them.  It isn't cheap, but there are also many destinations that cater to budget tourists.  I think a visitor to the Faroes gets what they pay for.  Breathtaking scenery and the freedom to wander endlessly with almost zero crowds.  I've been several times and the longest line I've waited in was at the grocery in Torshavn.  Regardless, when I said \"resources\" I wasn't referring to only money.  That leads to...",
                    "Driven: Motivation, ingenuity, resiliency, and fortitude are all resources as well.  These are qualities that a visitor to the Faroes should have because it isn't a polished and easy destination that lays everything out at your feet.  You have to go get it, and that isn't easy in a tiny chain of islands in the middle of the North Atlantic.  But it shouldn't be easy, otherwise it would be trampled by tourist hordes the same way Iceland has been.  For the visitor who can plan accordingly, listen to the advice that locals are more than happy to provide, spend some real time researching and learning about the place, and bounce back when things don't go as planned, the Faroes is a truly incredible place.",
                    "Flexible: Of course it's impossible to plan around the weather in the Faroes, but proper planning means taking into account the erratic weather and having a backup plan if needed.  Bad weather and all the delays and cancellations that come with it should be taken in stride.  Otherwise, it causes blame to be hurled in the wrong direction out of pure frustration.  I've had many flight cancellations and delays, but I understand that such a thing is a very real possibility when traveling to that part of the world.",
                    "So yes, that sentence sums up almost perfectly.  Anyone who wants an inexpensive, easy, and predictable vacation can quickly find hundreds of options that are perfect for them.  Everyone else who is ok with a more expensive trip that requires more research and may not go exactly as planned will have an amazing time here.",
                    "Or they could just, you know, improve the helicopter availability.",
                    "Good idea!  Now tell me who's going to pay for it.  You?  Helicopter transportation is already heavily subsidized.  Should the Faroese government just reach into their magic bag of unlimited funds and foot the bill for more flights?",
                    "At this point, I'm not even sure what your point is anymore.  Do you want to open the Faroes up to mass tourism so it can turn into Iceland 2.0?  Do you want the roads clogged with ignorant tourists who simply stop their rental car in the middle of the road to take pictures?  Do you want plastic bottles and food containers to outnumber the birds on Mykines?  You seem to love the idea of a version of the Faroes where all the complicated tourism logistics are worked out and paid for by the government, but you haven't taken a second to consider what that might look like in the long run.",
                    "My point is just that a lot fewer people would leave disappointed if they had more helicopter availability (and they could charge for it, I don’t care).",
                    "But it’s pointless to argue because it sounds like you actually want people to leave the Faroe Islands disappointed, which is weird. But whatever. Maybe you can sit at the airport and turn people away if they aren’t good enough for you.",
                    "Of course I don't want people to leave disappointed.  However, as I've said a couple times already, I don't want traveling to the Faroes to be as easy as a lot of other places that have become overrun by tourists as a result.  I think you may recognize that phrase, assuming you've been reading my posts.  I'm aware of very many people who leave the Faroes disappointed anyway.  Do you?  It seems like you're arguing for a solution to a problem that is mostly made up by you.",
                    "Have you thought about staying the night? The island is infinitely more special after the last ferry has left.",
                    "Indeed, a few of the cabins on Mykines are also available on Airbnb.   Just don't be expecting lavish accommodations.",
                    "I think that goes for Mykines in a nutshell!",
                    "How would we go about staying the night is there a hotel or anything of the sort, I've heard the island is quite small",
                    "There's Kristianshús which is a hostel there, not sure of contact details. From my last knowledge there's a bed and breakfast there ( http://www.magenta.fo/en/mykines-2/). It's all simple accommodation, you're not going to get anything above 2 star. But having the tranquillity is worth a prolonged stay.",
                    "Thank you I will look into it",
                    "If you can't manage any other options, sunset with the puffins and sheep is pretty fun. Hope you enjoy the faroes.",
                    "You can reserve by email, but just showing up also works fine. It's a nice, odd place and cheap too. I spent two nights (boarlt in, heli out) and loved it. The evenings are special indeed.",
                    "Last time I needed to contact them, Kristianshus was pretty response on Facebook, of all places.  https://www.facebook.com/Kristiansh%C3%BAs-Guesthouse-Mykines-850672731666852/",

                    "First thing that comes to mind is Sirkus. It's a bar with a small stage and a cozy atmosphere. They pretty much have some music performance every week, and host everything from metal to poetry reading.",

                    "Tutl the recordstore also have some concerts through the summer, but i could imagine those are just artists signed to their label.",
                    "Lastly there is Maggies in Nólsoy. They have concerts once or twice a week through the summer. There are plenty of people that take the trip and come home with the last ferry. They've had several sold out shows.",
                    "Those are the regular small venues i can think of at the moment. Some of them are probably fully booked for the Ólavsøku days, but if you are in Tórshavn the surrounding days, it could be doable.",
                    "Café Natur is especially good if you play rock/folksy or country music. I'm not sure if they are entirely genre specific though"

                    "Hi,we've just booked our tickets to fly to the Faroe Islands beginning of August (5th to 13th) - now it's time to start looking at rental cars. I've read road conditions are overall very good - would there be any reason not to pick the smallest (cheapest) model they have? We're pretty much going to be based out of Thorshavn and do day-trips to the most known sightseeing spots (Mykines, Vestmanna, Gasadalur, Saksun, Gjorgv, etc.). Thanks!",
                    "When we went we had a Suzuki Vitara, but that was only because there was 4 of us with luggage. I would go for a compact personally if it was just two of us so there is a bit of room, not a sub-compact, but that's up to you. We didn't travel on any rough terrain really, except for maybe one road but any car could handle it I would say.",
                    "I had a fairly cheap Citroen Cactus and it handled just fine. The roads are great, the only time you aren’t on a nicely paved road is in some of the tunnels and also the roads to a few of the hikes are just dirt and loose rocks, but we had no issues.",
                    "I rented the same vehicle last December - I had no issues with road conditions at all.",
                    "A lot of the companies list the lowest prices for the smallest cars, however they actually dont have this size available and you'll therefore get a free upgrade.",

                    "Hi all, We are planning a trip to Faroe Islands. We would leave on the 26th of September in the morning. I was wondering if there are any rooms or local b&b we can book, near the airport, instead of hotels? I looked at Airbnb but there was only one or two options. On the visit Faroe Islands website there seems to be quite a few options, but no websites or emails are mentioned.",
                    "Thanks in advance!",
                    "There’s not really anything by the airport. We stayed at an Airbnb only 10-15mins away. Have you tried that?",
                    "15 minutes by car or by foot?  I'm just not sure how to get to the airport by 6am.",
                    "Car. Are you flying out of Vagar? It’s kind of isolated. We stayed overnight in the next little town over. It was pretty inexpensive. Rented a whole house for 110$ USD a night. Cozy and comfortable.",
                    "Thanks very much!",
                    "Everybody usually stays in Tórshavn the night before an early flight. Just get up early and take the morning bus :)",
                    "Oh that's definitely a possibility! Any details for the bus? Timetable, location and prices? Thanks a lot!",
                    "First bus looks like it leaves Torshavn at 5:50 am which might not be too good. I was there last week and used Bil Taxi (http://taxi.fo/en/). They were really good and charge a fixed price per person to the airport. Think they have an app as well.",
                    "That's very much appreciated. How long is the bus? I'm guessing since there aren't many flights, arriving anytime before 7 am should be fine. How long did security take you?",
                    "5:50 bus will get you to the airport for 6:35 and goes from the ferry terminal. It only runs mon-fri though. If you're going at a weekend the first bus is an hour later. Security takes no time at all - we arrived an hour before takeoff at the airport, checked in luggage, went through security and still had loads of time before boarding.",
                    "That's awesome. We only have hand luggage so should be even quicker. Our flight is mid-week so we'll probably just take the bus! Thank you for your kind help.",
                    "No problem - have a great trip!",
                    "Check www.SSL.fo/en, route 300 for the timetable. Buses depart from the ferry terminal in Tórshavn and stop at SMS and along the highway leading north as well. Tickets onboard, either cash or by debit card. I think it was 80 DKK per person.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "How do you plan to get around the islands the rest of your trip? I rented a car and it was relatively inexpensive for all of the freedom you get with it. Just a consideration :) Also, check in and security takes only a few minutes. There are only 2 gates at the airport and if you are only bringing hand luggage, security will go quickly. Have a great trip!!",
                    "That's awesome! We do have a car but we have to return it the night before.",
                    "Oh bummer! Maybe try extending it through the morning? I imagine the extended price will be cheaper than the price of a taxi and stress of making sure you get there on time. Just a thought.  Ugh I’m jealous! I want to go back to the land of two-way, one lane streets!",
                    "There are plenty of those here in England! I am happy to recommend if you want!",
                    "Still haven’t been to England! It is on my list but I don’t know that London is...I want to explore beautiful countryside instead.",
                    "London is great (where I reside). But if you have time, I'd recommend one or more of the following places: The lake district, Cornwall, Wales, and of course Scotland (Edinburgh and the Lochs)."

We won't be arriving until late at night so we'd be available from the 31st through the 8th. We'll be spending the first couple of days exploring Tórshavn and the surrounding area, then we'll be hiking the other areas of the islands after. We'll be spending every night in the capital, though, in an Airbnb, so if anyone would like to meet up and hang out, maybe have a beer or two, that would be really cool! I'd especially love it if you could teach us a bit of Faroese or about the local cuisine :)",

                    "Hi all, I am a German medical student. During the first two years of studies, an internship in care/nursing activities are part of the curriculum. I would very much like to do this internship in the Faroe Islands. As the Tórshavn and Klaksvík hospitals already declined my request, I would like to apply in Tvøroyri on Suðuroy. As I do not know whether Faroese hospitals are used to such internships, it would be great to know somebody who works in that hospital as a personal contact might help with such an application. Does anyone know somebody who works in Tvøroyri’s hospital? As nursing interns are supposed to do very basic work, they can provide real help already within relatively short internships (1 month). This is why German hospital accept nursing interns very willingly. Payment is not needed (and not common in German hospitals). Best wishes from Germany!",

We also are a civilised country with very strong workers unions, and unpaid work is not on any of their agendas in any way possible. You may want to leave that particular part out your application, as any HR manager on the Faroes would treat a paper with those words on them like any other piece of trash that ends up in the bin.",
                    "there's been plenty of it, but it requires a work permit just like paid work, so that's where the problem is for most employers. However, there have been volunteers working in the Faroes in different fields, it's not that unheard of. Internships in the medical sector could be difficult to come by because of a difference in the education system maybe. But that's just my guess..."

                    "Hello! I'm a uni student of linguistics who's very interested in the Faroese language, and I'll be one of the students at the Faroese Summer Institute with the University this August. Was just wondering if anyone else is going this summer, as I'm a little worried about going and knowing no one (though I suppose that's part of the experience).",
                    "Also, does anyone know anyone who's completed the program and continued to keep up their Faroese afterwards? I'll be looking for ways to keep practicing and improving afterwards, so any tips would be appreciated!",
                    "Hi, I was at the \"Nordkurs\" summer course last year. It's for Nordic students who already know North Germanic, but it's probably quite similar.",
                    "I currently have kept much of the Faroese, but it flows together the Icelandic and Old Norse I've learned, and even my own Norwegian :P",
                    "The other people there were cool though. Can't be that bad people of they choose to learn Faroese.",
                    "Howdy, i can't help it, but i must ask you what it was like to learn these other languages in an institutional setting.",
                    "Im preparing myself to apply to the university of Wisconsin-Madison and i want to obtain a degree in scandinavian studies. The one thing in this world that i know i love is Scandinavian language and history so i thought i might as well go to school to learn more and get a degree in that field of study.",
                    "Can you see anyone with a degree in the culture and languages of scandinavia finding a job or career in anything remotely related to the linguistics aspect of the subject?",
                    "Im trying to research this before i submit to a life of student loans.",

                    "Eh, I can picture it. There definitely are jobs. But most I know are academic, and kinda contested. No idea how it is outside Norway.",

                    "I went with some lovely people from all over the world, and it was very social. I still keep in touch with some of them. Also, you will have some great teachers!",
                    "Enjoy the course! I'm sure you will have a great time.",

                    "I've always been told that virtually all Faroese, young and old alike, are fluent in Danish. As such, being Swedish (but fluent in Danish, though I speak it more clearly than Danes), I had zero qualms about conversing with locals in it during my short holiday in the Faroes (Midvágur and Tórshavn).",
                    "While almost all people I spoke to were indeed fluent (with most speaking rigsdansk), I came across a young bus driver (slightly older than me) on line 300 who appeared to genuinely struggle to speak the language (for example he didn't seem to know the word \"student/studerende\", instead saying \"lésandi\" - though I understood it, as I understand a significant amount of Faroese in general).",
                    "I can perfectly understand why this would be the case; I doubt most people, especially outside Tórshavn, get that much active practice in Danish in everyday life. It just goes against what I've read online and heard from others.",
                    "So my matter-of-fact question is: next time I'm going to really isolated places such as Fugloy and remote parts of Suduroy.",
                    "Should I then make sure to simplify my vocabulary and speak extra slowly when conversing with locals (I absolutely can do this, but just want to be aware)? Does it vary between age groups?",
                    "I don't know if people in Tórshavn are better at Danish. The elderly are maby not as good at pronunciation as younger people, because of the old ways of learning Danish(Gøtudanskt). I think it mostly depends on whether the person consumes more or less Danish media, or if the person has been living in Denmark. As for simplifying your vocabulary, I think it can be seen as a little condescending by some. I would just speak properly and then if someone has a hard time understanding you, maby you can try to simplify. But that's just my take on it.",
                    "If you don't follow Danish media, doesn't that mean you don't really follow much at all?",
                    "There is other other media to consume other than Danish. Kringvarp Føroya (kvf.fo) is the national radio and television, which is in Faroese. A lot of people watch NRK, which is the Norwegian national radio and television. And in the age of internet most people watch all sorts of American and other international news.",
                    "[removed]",
                    "Why this insufferable know-it-all bot?",
                    "Mind that a matter of pride and stubborness may in place, too. Some locals simply want you to understand Faroese as they feel that they had been forced to speak Danish, and now the tides are turning. If they make an effort understanding Danish, Danish people should not be surprised to make an effort too. This is not always a consciously made decision though, many simply do not realise that they mix up words.",
                    "Also mind that most parts of the countryside outside Tórshavn is part of Tórshavns \"urban system\", with many thousands commuting to the capital for work or school every day. Even from Suðuroy it's commonplace to have a second home or room to stay in during working day nights. Buying a house in a village while working elsewhere is quite common, so there is no simple line between Tórshavn and the rest. This makes it extremely hard to state any conclusions on whether people speak better Danish here or there.",
                    "Even kids from outer islands have travelled around, learned 'proper' Danish in school, and watch Danish television. So rather than a regional thing, it's a blend of a tad of nationalism and a generational thing.",
                    "I must say I truly admire and even envy the nationalism of the Faroese. Although you may not agree with my views, I truly, truly hope you don't suffer the same fate as my country, with \"förortssvenska\" becoming commonplace even among native Swedes (who think it's \"cool\"!!!) and regard it as a dialect rather than a mixture of broken Swedish and other languages.",
                    "You're absolutely right to want people to know the local language, at least if planning to live there. I could actually imagine settling down there (preferably somewhere remote but with a bus line) after I've finished my education, and would make sure to become fluent in Faroese ASAP first thing I do.",
                    "(yes, I'll admit it out loud: after my short visit, I think I'm in love with your country)",
                    "I must say, objectively, that Faroese (and even Götudanskt) sounds so much more beautiful than (standard) Danish :D I honestly wish I could speak it (I do understand many things when eavesdropping on locals - including everything one tourist office worker said during a phone call to someone else - but I myself sadly only know a few phrases)",
                    "On-topic: great info, thanks!",
                    "Yeah I would advise against simplifying your Danish unless the person you're talking to is struggling to understand you. It will come off as condescension. We village people may not have as fancy clothes as those \"big city\" Havnafólk, but we're no less intelligent or educated.",
                    "Danish is taught in school as a second language, though from an early age, so most people have had it as a school subject for 7 years or so, and are perfectly sufficient. But there are always a few people who have a hard time in school for whatever reason, my guess is that applies to the bus driver you speak of.",
                    "We village people may not have as fancy clothes as those \"big city\" Havnafólk",
                    "Wtf even is this. We all wear the same kind of clothes?",
                    "It is an attempt at satire. I was trying to depict an exaggerated stereotypical \"bygdafrell\".",
                    "I guess I failed.",
                    "Young people tend to be a bit more proficient in both Danish and English than older people, but afaik everyone has a good enough understanding of danish to where they can ask you to simplify or they will understand you if you were to ask them whether or not you should simplify.",
                    "IMO it's hard to make a general statement so i would just go in assuming that they speak proficient danish, even outside the larger cities and towns it is the norm to be able to communicate in danish while those who can't are outliers.",
                    "Basically just be a bit attentive, if they seem to be struggling you can simplify but don't expect this to be the case especially in the service/tourism industry.You are also absolutely right regarding the danish ability degrading due to lack of use, many of my friends from the faroes went to technical or business gymnasiums which mean they don't have to take danish classes, and their danish has clearly degraded quite a bit. But then again they are all completely fluent in english."

My friend who went with me is turning 50 this year and I wanted to make her a bracelet out of the 50 øre coins. I kept them out for so long but now am moving and they got packed away. So, I’m in a bind. I’m in search of 2 or 3 of these coins in decent condition (good enough so you can read the 50). Does anyone know where I can get 3 of these to the US? I will pay for shipping or whatever I need. I’m desperate.",

                    "well, the toll isn't so high, so good for the Faroe. I wonder how much the tool for the 22 Km tunnel will be.",
                    "8) I don't know that it's that difficult. A few people feel negatively, some positively, and some are neutral. It's not  a big deal to most. I don't think there's so much to say about it really.",
                    "I started behind a store counter when I was 14, I got the job through one of my friends dad, who owned the store. I can imagina a lot of Faroese teens have a similar story.",
                    "There are not a lot of peopla that are in Sandoy that need to go to Suduroy and vise versa. Usually you have to go to the capital if you are missing somthing in your village.",
                    "If this isn't too impolite, what's your current job? I'm curious about jobs in Faroe islands because I'm used to see companies that hire people, and here I've seen just a few (even if I guess the fishing industry is relatively big).",
                    "2) At present they build a tunnel between Tórshavn and Strendur/Toftir (with three entrances and a roundabout underwater), called Eysturoyartunnilin. When finished, the tunnel between Tórshavn and Sandoy will be started with. They have already suggested a third tunnel between Sandoy and Suðuroy be built afterwards, but this would require a 27 km (?) two-tubed tunnel, incredibly expensive. I once asked the Minister of Transport if, when the Sandoyartunnil is finished, the ferry from Tórshavn to Tvøroyri/Suðuroy could start sailing from Sandoy to Hvalba/Suðuroy, which would reduce sailing distances by 50% and thus offer twice as many trips per day. However, he refused this idea for several reasons:",
                    "No one really wants to get from Sandoy to Suðuroy or v.v. Perhaps one or two people per day, max, I'd say, with a handfull of tourists extra in the summer months. The current route via Tórshavn is sufficient for the ultra low demand. And the existing ferry to Suðuroy is already unprofitable, government-subsidized, so why add a competing link? Also regionally and culturally the two isles are unconnected. Interaction in terms of migration for instance is limited. So only a handful of tourists would use a Sandoy-Suðuroy service, whereas it needs hundreds of paying passengers per week to turn them cost-effective...",
                    "Because so many Suðuroy people work in Tórshavn, and not a single one in Sandoy (I checked the statistics, see my thesis), going via Sandoy would increase the hassle a lot. Their two hour napping time would be reduced to one hour, with an uncomfy trip by bus or car for the final leg of the trip. At present, Suðuroy people often leave their car on Suðuroy as they can manage all distances in Tórshavn on foot/by bus, which saves a fortune over time. Plus, when the ferry terminal is in town, you don't need much spare time to make sure you don't miss the ferry. The farther away the terminal, the more can go wrong underway, the more spare time you'd need.",
                    "A ferry route between Sandoy (Sandur) and Suðuroy (Hvalba?) would require one or two new ferry terminals. Especially when the current beautiful Smyril ferry would need to dock in Sandur and Hvalba, those infrastructures would be big investments. If a special new ferry were to be bought, smaller infrastructure investments do not weigh up to the purchase of ferries, hiring of extra staff, etc,",
                    "The seas between Sandoy and Suðuroy are quite uncomfortable. Often full of currents, gusts and eddies. It would make the timetable tide-dependent, no one likes that when your work or school starts at 9 and finishes at 17 o'clock. The Tórshavn-Tvøroyri route on the other hand sails in the \"shadow\" of these eddies, gusts and currents. Much more comfy.",
                    "Last but not least: the minister, from Suðuroy himself, likes how \"his\" big ferry docks in Tórshavn 2-3 times a day, sailing inches away past the Prime Minister's windows, reminding him and Tórshavn of Suðuroy's presence. To move the ferry to Sandur on Sandoy, in the \"middle of nowhere\", feel like an insult.",
                    "Until 1993 all Sandoy ferries departed from Tórshavn. As you can imagine, it added 30 mins (for Skopun) to 1 h (to Sandur) to the total ferry time. The current Sandoy ferry terminal has reduced travel times significantly and as a result the same ferry can make three times as many trips per day. Combined with other projects (Vágar tunnel, 2002; Kollafjørður tunnel, 1992) the current situation is a very major improvement. The port is too small however for Suðuroy's beast and the isle of Sandoy lies in the way, meaning zero travel time gain if the Suðuroy ferry were to depart from here as well.",
                    "Iceland isn't all volcanic - the eastern fjords and westfjords have almost zero volcanic activity. These regions are similar to the Faroe Islands, but Iceland's central regions are of another geological chapter.",
                    "cattle grids, to ban nosy sheep from people's gardens (in winter sheep can often roam settlements freely though).",
                    "I'd say positive. The whole independence debate is not if Denmark is a friend or an enemy, but whether it is a better friend than other friends. And, of course, how viable the Faroe Islands would be on their own when a crisis strikes.",
                    "Ferries are also VERY expensive. They need a lot of maintenance, staff, safety equipment, fuel... paid for by the passengers and subsidies. The tunnels are no different. A land tunnel is also easier to maintain than a winding mountain road when it comes to winter servicing. However, only in times of plenty, the upfront investments are doable. When the 1990s crisis stroke, many projects were postponed or cancelled. The ferry port to Sandoy was perhaps the only project to be finished during the crisis.",

                    "I'm astonished by the cultural differences between Sandoy and Suðuroy and by the fact that the inhabitants of one of the two islands never go to the other. What do people do in such small islands and why wouldn't they want to be closer each other?",
                    "Well, cultural differences, that is within the Faroese context. Almost all islands are Tórshavn-oriented, and interaction between regions is limited to neighbour-to-neighbour. Since Sandoy and Suðuroy lack a direct link since the 1950s, they have grown apart. Suðuroy as a result of the distance to the rest always was an odd outlier, more eccentric.",
                    "Being autonmous mini societies, there was also little reason for local interaction.",
                    "Suðuroy people often leave their car on Suðuroy as they can manage all distances in Tórshavn on foot/by bus, which saves a fortune over time. Plus, when the ferry terminal is in town, you don't need much spare time to make sure you don't miss the ferry. The farther away the terminal, the more can go wrong underway, the more spare time you'd need.",
                    "Aren't there also commuters from Sandoy who work in Tórshavn? They land in Gamlarætt, not Tórshavn center, so they need their car or a bus I guess",
                    "True! But their journey was always much shorter, so I guess a bit of hassle was ok, and the travel time savings are in relative terms a lot more than compared to the Suðuroy ferry, where the Sandoy-Hvalba route would save only a few percentages.",
                    "I'm not sure though.",
                    "Edit: fewer people. Sandoy is one third of the pop of Suðuroy.",
                    "The Gamlarætt port was welcomed by Sandoyingar, whereas a Sandur-Hvalba route does not seem appreciated by Suðuroyingar. Politics will listen to local desires too (whether they make logically sense or not), given the strong regional investment policies and electoral system.",

It's a normal leisure activity, not a normal everyday life activity. Price levels also defy restaurant culture. Most restaurants are in central Tórshavn.",
                    "Petrol stations and snacks: that relates pretty much to heavy Sunday opening regulations. Everything used to be closed on Sundays, except for petrol stations, which used this monopoly position to become pseudo supermarkets. Fast food is a new thing and like Denmark, mainly relies on hot dogs and pizza.",

But if the weather is adverse, nothing else than radiomedical support can be given. That's life on the edge of the world. Every village (!) has an AED on some central wall.",

When finished, the tunnel between Tórshavn and Sandoy will be started with. They have already suggested a third tunnel between Sandoy and Suðuroy be built afterwards, but this would require a 27 km (?) two-tubed tunnel, incredibly expensive. I once asked the Minister of Transport if, when the Sandoyartunnil is finished, the ferry from Tórshavn to Tvøroyri/Suðuroy could start sailing from Sandoy to Hvalba/Suðuroy, which would reduce sailing distances by 50% and thus offer twice as many trips per day. However, he refused this idea for several reasons:",

                    "Denmark doesn't own the Faroe Islands, it is a former colony of Denmark. Today, the Faroe Islands is a semi-autonomous nation within the kingdom of denmark, where domestic matters are largely settled locally.",
                    "The Faroe Islands (population: ~50,000 mind you) rely on Denmark for some services, that are not feasible to set up from scratch for such a small population (military, health care, police etc.) and Denmark get to keep a vestige of their former colonialism along with influence in north atlantic matters, in conjunction with a similar arrangement with Greenland. Denmark thus maintains a military and political presence in the North atlantic, and is considered a major player in north atlantic/artctic matters.",
                    "Pretty sure health care is taken care of locally. Denmark has the police, large parts of foreign policy and immigration.",
                    "True, but they still rely on Denmark for education, training and special equipment/treatments to some degree. It's definitely not as simple as I put it above, but I figured that I should leave it at that for the sake of brevity.",
                    "yeah they do rely on danish personnel to some extend, simply because it's hard to find educated doctors in the Faroes, and everyone understands Danish. There's certain procedures that can't be done in the Faroes, so patients are moved to mainly Iceland or Denmark. Otherwise the health sector is pretty independent... You don't need to go to Denmark to get a degree as a doctor, you can go anywhere as long as the education is recognized. I don't disagree with what you're saying, just wanted to point out that the health sector is more of a voluntary partnership with some danish institutions than something Denmark has actually any control over. :)",
                    "No. 1: The Faroes were never a colony. It used to be a tax-tributary country to the Norwegian Crown and Faroese officials swore allegiance to the Norwegian Crown until the Dano-Norwegian Twinned Realms were sundered, whereupon the Faroes became personal property of the former Dano-Norwegian king, who remained king of Denmark, at this point the Faroes held the status of a county (amt) and was incorporated into the Danish Realm in 1852 when the Constitution of the Unitary Realm of Denmark was introduced in the Faroes - Home Rule was attained in 1948 and was expanded in 2005.",
                    "No. 2: The Unitary Realm of which the Faroes are a part does not recognize the Faroese as a people, therefore they cannot be a nation - as this would be in conflict with both the stipulations of the Home Rule Act and the Constitution.",
                    "Denmark feels ashamed for their colonial history, or at least somewhat responsible, and kind of uses the Realm as a way to compensate the (mostly healed) harm. It also realises that a 50,000 state needs a good friend to survive. Bundle powers. Sometimes marriage is the best way to settle a good relationship, right? Even if it isn't for love but for saving money on a combined budget overall. Yes, that divorce is always a risk in such relationships, but as long as all works out, it's fine.",
                    "This whole reasoning of colonialism is mainly true for Greenland, but since the two colonies share a common past and certain common characteristics (fisheries, small nation, limited local brainpower, political status), what counts for Greenland should also count for Faroe.",
                    "One difference with Greenland is that Greenland is costing the Danes a lot more (a factor ten, minimum). But, with so many mineral resources, the odds for cash back are - hypothetically - higher. Faroe on the other hand doesn't cost much and won't deliver much.",
                    "For many average Danes, the Faroe Islands aren't even on their radar, but as long as it doesn't hurt them (financially), why alter things?",
                    "Tl;dr: history.",
                    "The geopolitical arguments that others said are also legit, but imho a little less important.",

                    "At present the fisheries go well and foreign market situations are good: the EU has/had banned export of fish to Russia for geopolitical reasons, but because Faroe is not part of the EU, it has become one of the few exporters to Russia. That is a big market for such a tiny country.",

                    "Hello everyone. I'll be visiting in mid May. Lots of conflicting information is floating around about the hike to Drangarnir.  Is it true you now must hire a guide for this hike and it's only accessible on certain days of the week? I'm curious because I dont see how this is enforcible not to mention the \"guided\" hikes all begin at noon time which is much later in the day then myself and my group had planned on going. Obviously we want to respect the rules but we can't seem to find official answers. Thanks for your help!",
                    "According to this website, you can only hike to Drangarnir with a guide. That's the official tourist office on the island of Vágar.",
                    "The path is through privately owned area, which is why you need the owners permission to hike there. Otherwise it might be considered trespassing, and you'd get fined accordingly. The arguments for why they don't want people walking through unguided and at random times, is because it bothers the sheeps and nature around them.",

The Enniberg hike should be awesome but I never did it, unfortunately. Also the boat trip to Fugloy is superb, even when you don't get off board but take a round trip. I also love wandering around through Tórshavn. The great thing is that FO is so small that you can squeeze a lot into a cramped schedule.

                    "I saw the helicopter cancelled about a few times and the ferry once. Plus on one ocassion, when I was on Mykines, the ferry couldn't enter the port because of the swell (it was windstill) so she waited 1,5 hours about 300 meters offshore. On the very moment that they decided to return to Vágar, the swell disappeared and they landed anyway.",
                    "Never go to Mykines on your last day, but certainly do it on any other day. I think cancellation risk is 5% for May, a bit less at the end of May. It is worth an unexpected overnight stay however, definitely.  That's kind of the adventure that the place stands for! Or much better: a planned overnight stay. When the tourists leave with the evening ferry, the isle is suddenly your own and the village goes from a \"Disney set\" to a normal village.",

                    "We're visiting the Faroes in May. We've been seeing a lot of posts online about the new rules to hike to certain places such as Kalsoy, Mykines, Drangarnir. Seems like you need to pay a guide and also a fee to go out to some of these places now. There is no concrete info on when these rules take effect, if they have started already and what the restrictions are. Any info is appreciated!",
                    "Hi - I am currently here visiting the Faroe Islands and the only way to hike to Drangarnir is now by guide only. I asked Visit Vagar yesterday if we were able to use any tour guide company considering the sign says the tours are only on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, and the answer was no. The owner will only allow people to hike to Drangarnir thru their preferred guide.",
                    "I'll circle back tomorrow about Kalsoy - heading there tomorrow to see if we can hike to the Kallur Lighthouse. Visit Torshavn said that they have heard that too will be similar to Drangarnir but thought it would be starting 1 May when their tourist season officially begins.",
                    "Thanks for the information! This is so unfortunate...I don’t feel like spending the 550DKK it appears they want for these group hikes for access to each route. A huge appeal of the Faroes was the ability to rent a car and pretty much just explore. It’s a shame if someone disrespected their environment to the point they felt this was necessary, and even more a shame if this is just a money grab.",
                    "It's not so much that individuals have disrespected the environment (though there certainly have been plenty of such cases, stomping on the roof of puffin nests so that the bird comes out for a picture, chasing more or less newborn lamb so that a perfectly cute pic can be taken, stealing eggs, etc)",
                    "It's just the sheer amount of people who are going these places, the traffic is not good for the environment, tearing up the ground and such.  On mykines they have been working on making proper paths now, where before it was just grass, or rather mud.",
                    "Kallur lighthouse, I know the farmer who owns the land has been annoyed over tourists not closing gates, letting sheep roam to other parts etc.",
                    "Also, the tourist season is in the middle of bird breeding season, having an explosion in numbers of people who are roaming everywhere in the countryside, many not knowing correct procedures when stumbling over full nest...",
                    "Also safety, there has been an absolutely marked increase in SAR operations these last few years, where anything from just lost tourists, to broken bones, hypothermia and even fatalities have been on the board.",
                    "Yes, just roaming is appealing, but with everything above, and when you randomly wander into sheep herding efforts and scatter the entire flock because you didn't bother to check with the locals, it's easy to see why people are starting to take money for your exploration.",
                    "Thanks so much for the info! If you could keep the updates coming that’d be great!",
                    "Sorry for the delay - Weather was absolutely horrid and decided not to go to Kalsoy on Friday - but I was able to get some information from the visitor's centre right be the ferry.",
                    "You do need a guide now to get to the Kallur Lighthouse, and the only guide is the farmer himself who owns the land. It does cost $485DKK per person. From what they were saying at the information centre is that he isn't limited to a few days for hikes to the lighthouse like Drangarnir is - he just wants to ensure people going are getting there safely and on the correct path. Like Hitno said, it's due to the amount of traffic and the protection of his land and animals.",
                    "Sounded like you could go very last minute to no notice and the farmer will take you. She was going to call and see if he could take us up Friday afternoon when we could get the next ferry. The information centre is where you go and they will call the farmer to see if he's available.",
                    "There is plenty of other options for hiking that you could do for free and without guides. When you arrive at the Vagar airport, take the hiking guide book. The one hike up to Leitisvatn lake was absolutely stunning and took about 2.5 hours. Also plenty of waterfalls on the side of the road you can hike next to as well.",
                    "Thanks so much for the reply! Your info is very helpful.",
                    "Sucks about the guide being needed now to go out to the lighthouse, but its understandable.",
                    "http://visitvagar.fo/welcome-to-vagar/activities/hiking/drangarnir/",
                    "Here’s what I can find about the hike to Drangarnir. They want $90 to go out there, only available 3X a week, and are saying you can be fined for hiking on this route without permission.",
                    "Very disappointing to find out less than a month prior to the trip",
                    "I found this a few hours before my flight left to Faroe Islands. Very disappointing especially since that is one of the main hikes we wanted to do. Kallur Lighthouse is the same, but the farmer is not charging as much money and is much more flexible on when you can do the hike.",
                    "As far as I could figure out last summer, the need for a payment and a guide was decided on but not enforced, when I was there. I'll admit I only paid the 'entrance' fee at the shop on the island (and as far as I could tell, a lot didn't even do that).",
                    "It seems that according to this https://visitfaroeislands.com/plan-your-stay/transport/guidelines-mykines/ they seem to have gone back on the 'guide necessary'-rule, the 'entrance' fee still is obligatory, which actually I find an acceptable amount considering how overrun the island gets from hikers.",
                    "If this is true for all the spots, then I have no issues. I certainly understand them requesting a small fee to go out to some of these places to pay for upkeep or whatever, but I do have a problem if its going to be mandatory to pay for a guide to hike out to Drangarnir or Kallur Lighthouse. A lot of the appeal of FI is being able to go out on your own and explore, it would be a shame if some people did something stupid out there and made it to the point where the government decided to not allow people out to these places alone.",
                    "Oh, just to clarify, when I was there i only encountered the rule on Mykines, but I never got to Drangarnir, so I might have missed any rules for that. I did visit Kallur Lighthouse and I never heard of any specific rules or fees.",
                    "Well, I saw some behaviors on Mykines that really made my hair stand up (like leaving the path just to get nearer to the puffins for a picture)",
                    "People disrespecting the nature on Mykines is pretty crappy. Probably a good thing to enforce a fee/guide out there since from my understanding it’s a pretty sensitive area for the puffins.",
                    "Very excited for my first trip to the Faroes next month!",
                    "This must have just changed today, because yesterday it said a guide was mandatory.",
                    "yeah, I still remember that page from last year and there was a small poster on Mykines as well detailing the new rules",
                    "It is mandatory to hava a guide to drangarnir. Source, Am a guide, and my dad owns land there",
                    "I haven't come across new hiking rules on tourism sites. Where did you see this info? I'd like to read more.",
                    "Saw this here in regards to the Mykines https://visitfaroeislands.com/plan-your-stay/transport/new-guidelines-mykines/ Also a lot of people who have come back have been posting stuff on Instagram about it as well for other areas.",
                    "Could you link to the stuff you've seen about Kalsoy and Drangarnir? Ill be going to the Faroes next month and those 2 hikes are some of what we're most excited for! Ive see the rules about Mykines and we're going to pass on it because we don't want to get stuck out there or have to pay an exorbitant fee for a guide, but I haven't read anything about new rules for the other sites.",
                    "It's Mykines only (but not for long, my gut feeling says).",
                    "Donno about Kalsoy, but I can help with info about Drangarnar! I am a guide, and my dad and uncle own land there. The guide days are 3 days a week I think, Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday.( I think lol) You can hire a guide via hiking.fo, or call my boss on  +298 223072, kind regards Magnus",
                    "Page isn't coming up?",
                    "As far as I know, Mykines was the big on to need a guide. Haven't heard anything about Kalsoy or Drangarnir...",
                    "It is also mandatory for drangarnir, donno about kalsoy though",
                    "The site says \"It is recommended that you book a local guide. We recommend that you contact one of these incoming agencies or local guides for more information if you plan on visiting Mykines:\"",
                    "So I take it having a guide is not mandatory?",
                    "You don't need a guide to go to Mykines. However, if you want to leave the area that the ferry drops you off and hike to see the puffins and lighthouse, you must be accompanied by a guide. My understanding is that this could be any guide. Not necessarily a certain company.",
                    "For the mykines fee, can you pay when you get there at the tourist office?",
                    "We asked the tourist office and they said to pay online on the day you are going. It’s easier that way.",
                    "Thanks, there was a guy from hiking.fo that was enforcing the fee and had a phone where you can pay with a credit card on the spot."

I certainly understand them requesting a small fee to go out to some of these places to pay for upkeep or whatever, but I do have a problem if its going to be mandatory to pay for a guide to hike out to Drangarnir or Kallur Lighthouse. A lot of the appeal of FI is being able to go out on your own and explore, it would be a shame if some people did something stupid out there and made it to the point where the government decided to not allow people out to these places alone.",

                    "Hi everyone! Me and a friend are planning on coming to the islands in August, for 5 nights. Kind of unsure as to how to get around. For example, we are coming in from Copenhagen, and fly in to Vagar. But from there should we rent a car? or would it be best to get a bus? And is returning to the airport difficult? Also if anyone has a good itinerary on what to do that would be much appreciated! We are super excited!",
                    "Rental car companies are in the airport and are very easy. The buses are are also very easy to take. Check out www.ssl.fo/en . The last bus stop in Tórshavn is at https://goo.gl/maps/eqoRwXvNYcD2",
                    "As for attractions I would recommend Trælanípan, Gásadalur, Mykines (if you are lucky with the weather), and Kallur Lighthouse. All of these are quite a lot easier to get to if you have a car but it can be done without.",
                    "We went last year for a week, we are also going again this year in August like you! It’s such an amazing place you’re going to love it!",
                    "We stayed in an Airbnb on Streymoy so pretty central, we just drove around to each place during the day. You shouldn’t have to drive more than a few hours round trip due to the size of the islands. We got to see quite a lot in the week but missed out on a few places, hence why we’re returning!",
                    "Itinerary wise, here’s what we did as a guide:",
                    "Day 1; flight was delayed so didn’t arrive until around 9:30pm, picked up the rental car (62° north) and headed to the Airbnb then went to bed.",
                    "Day 2: we headed north to Tjørnuvik, a lovely village. Only one way in and out, there’s the waterfall ‘Fossá’ on the way so keep an eye out on the left. We hiked up the mountains towards Saksun but decided to turn back halfway. We didn’t want to have to hike back the whole way again for the car on our 1st day!  We then drove to Tórshavn as it was the Faroese national day, was lots of street food/beer stands and had a stroll around taking in the atmosphere.",
                    "Day 3: We took the ferry to Mykines in the morning and stayed overnight. We did the hike to the lighthouse and watched the sunset from up the hill on the way back.",
                    "Day 4: We took the ferry back in the morning then headed to Gásadalur, where the famous waterfall ‘Múlafossur’ is. Spent a couple of hours here then we drove back past Vagar airport to Leitisvatn, from here we hiked up to where probably the most well known place is. The ‘lake above the ocean’ the cliffs are incredible here and really magical when you see it in real life! We watched the sunset here then hiked back to the car. Was pretty late by then so went straight back to the Airbnb.",
                    "Day 5: We actually got up pretty late as we were so tired from the day before, was a busy day! But we drove to Saksun just after lunch, hiked up the mountain for an hour or so and took in some views. Then we headed back down and walked along the sand out in the lagoon, you can walk right to the ocean it’s an incredible place. One of my favourites! After we drove up to Gjógv and around Funningur for the sunset then headed back.",
                    "Day 5: We drove down to Sørvágur just passed the airport and hiked out to Tindhólmur, this is a pretty tough hike. The start is at the end of an old ship yard I think it was, was actually pretty hard to spot as we didn’t have any information about the hike. The terrain is pretty bad in places too and the trail disappears a lot, if there’s one at all. We spent most of the day here due to the initial confusion and finding the trails.",
                    "Day 6: We drove to Klaksvík to catch the ferry to Kalsoy, unfortunately we just missed it by one car so didn’t get to go. The next ferry wasn’t going to leave us enough time there so we drove up to some of  the northern islands. Had a look around Vidareidi and found a few waterfalls on our drive back.",
                    "I’d say the must see places would definitely be;",
                    "Gásadalur, Leitisvatn (Lake above the ocean) if you go early enough you could easily see these both in one day and still have plenty of time. Saksun and Tjørnuvik, both beautiful little villages and a lovely hike between them. Tindhólmur, quite a tough hike but well worth it! Kalsoy, which we didn’t get to see. Heard and seen only good things from here so we will make sure we get the ferry this time! There’s so many really but if you need any more tips let me know",

There was a guy more recently (but still ways back... 40 or 50 years ago ... guestimating) that wanted to be buried at Norðadalsskarð, apparently he petitioned for it, but was denied."

                    "Very excited to be visiting the islands in early September.  We are planning on doing four full days and have the following questions.",
                    "We are planning on renting a car from the airport and using it the duration of the trip. I'm assuming this would be the best option to see what the country has to offer but would love to hear if otherwise. We definitely want to venture out to some of the remote areas. Any rental companies to recommend?",
                    "With only 4 days, would you recommend having 1 home base or 2, staying a few nights at each? What would be the best areas to stay in if we plan on driving around to see most of the Islands' sites? We are looking at Airbnb's for lodging.",
                    "Is four days a decent amount of time to see/hike most things? We consider ourselves very fit in our late twenties. We are also very fast paced and are not looking for much of a 'relaxing' stay. There is the possibility we could extend to a fifth day.",
                    "Any tips are greatly appreciated!",
                    "Rental car is probably a good idea. There's been new rental companies popping up during the past years, don't have any experience with most of them. I would however stay away from AVIS.",
                    "Tórshavn is very central. Just look at google maps for the distance, with a car you can get from there to pretty much anywhere that has a direct road connection within 90 minutes.",
                    "Most things? No. If you actually want to see the Faroes you'll need at least a week. Having a car is jolly good, but as soon as it comes to some of the really nice spots like Mykines and Suðuroy you'll be limited by ferry timetables, which makes things so much more time consuming. So sure, you can stress through most of the hikes around the main islands (Streymoy/Eysturoy) within 4 days, but I wouldn't plan too many things \"off the beaten path\" in that case. Seems awfully stressful to me in any case, but maybe you like it that way ;)",
                    "Thank you!",
                    "I would personally recommend you to use 62°N or MakeTravel for car rental. They are in the more expensive end, but the cars are almost all brand new, and the service is great.",
                    "Thanks, will check them out for sure",
                    "Hello! I went last year and I was there for four days.",
                    "For a rental car, I used unicar and it was fine...no issues whatsoever. Picked it up and dropped off at the airport!",
                    "Like someone else said, Tórshavn is quite central, and we stayed in an Airbnb in Argir. It was a perfect spot, as we just headed or to a different part of the country each day!",
                    "My friends and I were originally there for four days, but our flight was delayed a day because of all the fog. But I thought it was enough time to do the highlights. We didn’t do any intense hikes, and we just drove around everywhere. We also stopped off like every five minutes of driving just to take in the views! If you’re just wanting to do the big stuff (Mulafossur, Sorvagsvatn, Gjogv and so on) then I think four days is alright! Be careful, though, as the weather is in charge of everything.",
                    "HAVE THE BEST TIME. The faroes were definitely one of my favorite places I’ve ever been!",
                    "Edited to add: we stayed here with three people and it was perfect and the host was very gracious and welcoming. Long link bc on mobile, sorry!",
                    "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13275873?location=T%C3%B3rshavn%2C%20Streymoy%2C%20Faroe%20Islands&s=e76cthIM",
                    "I can can concur with this post. I was there 3 weeks ago. I also used UNICAR it was perfect. They even let us keep the car longer when our departing flight was delayed by 6 hours. So we could see more. The point about ferry time tables, from the other post, is very accurate also. We almost got stuck haha.",
                    "We stayed in 4 places for the 4 nights. But this was more so we could see more locations and enjoy different properties. You could, if you were willing, do a drive \"home\" to the single location each night if you liked.",
                    "It was seriously stunning and lovely. I am currently posting a photo a day of the Faroes on my instagram if you are interested. http://instagram.com/timbohiatt",
                    "If you have questions or want more information then please PM me would be happy to give you any help you liked. Cause we learnt a lot but we had the absolute best time! :-)",
                    "We used http://www.streymcars.com for the rental. Even though they can arrange a pick up or drop-off at the airport for a surcharge, we just took the bus from the airport to the capital and picked it up from their base in Torshavn.",
                    "When you pick a car from the airport, keep in mind that you will most likely pay a surcharge plus you will also have to pay the tunnel toll to get to Torshavn where you might be staying on the first night.",
                    "Torshavn might be the only good place for tourists considering the various hotel and restaurant options available. No matter which island you are on, you are never too far away from Torshavn. You can always head back at the end of the day.",
                    "You might also want to look at staying in Klaksvik, if you want to spend more time exploring the islands in the east. Seemed like a cute little town worth staying at. But we didn't do that.",
                    "We also had 4 days like you, and for us it was perfect to get an idea of what the whole place is like. The car helped us in getting everywhere, plus we also had time to do 2 hikes. One to the Kallur Lighthouse, and the other to the lake in Sorvagsvatn."

I've just been accepted to study in the Faroe Islands for two years as apart of the Master's in West Nordic Studies - Governance and Sustainable Management program. I have never travelled to the Faroes or anywhere around the area, so I am unsure of how easy it is to find accommodations. If anyone could help me out with this, that would be great! Thanks!",

I am very interested in everything about the Faroe Islands and have been ever since December-ish when I researched for and wrote an essay about the role of music in the revitalization of the Faroese language (I was so interested I wrote 27 pages- 12 more than necessary!). I would love to make a friend from the Faroes! You can tell me anything you want about your life and even teach me some Faroese! I like cats, music, literature, and linguistics and speak English and Spanish. But I'll talk about anything! I would like to correspond over email, though we can start out messaging on Reddit if you feel more comfortable with that. I tend to take about a week to respond.",

                    "Hello all,",
                    "I am planning a trip to the islands most likely at the beginning of July for about 10 days by myself (mid 20s male) and have a few things I would like clarified/confirmed before I book flights and accommodations etc.",
                    "I greatly appreciate anyone taking the time to help me out in this regard.",
                    "I have read through the past 50 or so posts here to get a good general idea of the most important information and I have done a fair amount of googling as well. I just want to confirm what I have read is correct, all opinions/perspectives are appreciated.",
                    "Accommodations:",
                    "I'm very interested in tenting nearby villages and I have read that it is possible so long as you obtain permission from the land owner. I have read some people say that this is fairly easily done. Would you agree with this? How likely is it on a scale of 1-10 that I would be able to tent on someone's land? I'd obviously be very respectful of the land and leave nothing behind. I know that designated campgrounds are an option as well but I'm not as interested in that. Also, I'm aware the weather can be pretty messy so I'd have to be ok with that while being in a tent.",
                    "Alternatively I would aim for hostels/Air Bnb's to save costs. I'm having difficulties finding information on different hostels. I found a few in Torshavn, are there others? I've tried looking without too much luck. If someone could link websites that would be super helpful.",
                    "I've found a few AirBnBs that could be suitable.",
                    "Also, couch surfing. I haven't signed up yet but I'm thinking about it. Has anyone had any experience couch surfing in the Faroes?",
                    "Transit:",
                    "Judging from my research on rental cars, I think I'm going to pass on renting a car just because of the expense. So I'd be opting for public transport. I'm aware the timetables need to be studied carefully to plan my days and that not everywhere is accessible via public transport.",
                    "However, I've also read that hitchhiking is fairly easy to do. If I were to combine public transit and hitchhiking, would I be able to get around to the main points of interest? I'm alright with a few hours of travel time, I start my days early.",
                    "I think those are my main concerns that I'd like addressed before I move forwards on the trip. If anyone would like more info from me please ask.",
                    "Really appreciate anyone taking a stab at any of my questions. Apologies that some of these are repetitive, I've done my research, I just want confirmation/clarification to feel more comfortable.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "Hey there First of all, well done on the research. Spot on. My advice. Tents are always risky at the Faroes. The winds. Just DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE WINDS .I spent 3 weeks there. Public transport that includes ferries (except to mykinnes) is amazing. You need special tickets to mykinnes. Otherwise the busses and ferries are perfect to all islands. These 4 day tickets with unlimited hop on and off is the way to go. I always made back to Torshavn except when I was up north at klaksvik. Try airbnb. Otherwise. Enjoy the stay and the islands.",
                    "Hi, would you say that walking + using public transport is overall better than renting a bicycle and spending the whole trip on it?",
                    "Hiya. Bike. Sure. It's a personal choice there. If u r fit to go up and down and up and up and downhill. Why not. But beware. There are not any dedicated bikelanes. Public transport though is well networked. If u for mind shedding an extra dollar r two. Then you can rent a car as well",
                    "Thanks for the fast reply!",
                    "One more question - what do you think about camping elsewhere than in camping sites? I've read different opinions about it, some were saying that it is prohibited, some that it is too dangerous and some were completely OK with it.",
                    "The camp sites exist. Use them. I wouldn't camp outside camp sites. A because it is illegal. And b  ( no offence meant ) we completely undermine nature and wind. It can be lethal. Usually someone at the campsite might tell u that it could be super windy etc etc. But when u r out on it own. Not sure if us folks ( outsiders) will be able to judge that.",
                    "Edit. Don't camp elsewhere. That A just my two cents",
                    "Sounds reasonable, thanks. .)",
                    "You can ask the owner of the land to pitch a tent. However finding said person can be a challenge, as he could be at sea.",
                    "Or he might live on a different island... And sometimes the owner doesn't care, but you might be in trouble with the caretaker of the land.",
                    "We stayed for 4 nights in torshavn at an Airbnb. It was relatively cheap as we were 2. But the place was just amazing. The guy who rents out his place made us all breakfast every morning and was a good way to start the day. Plus talking to a local is always a good way to know more about a place. I can PM you the place if you like.",
                    "There are a few popular Couchsurfing hosts around the island, but you being a new member I am not sure how successful you will be in getting a host as you don't have any references yet. But it's still worth a try.",
                    "As for renting a car, I'd say it's worth it. I am a budget backpacker when I travel, but renting a car in the Faroe was one of those things that I think was worth every single penny. We landed at the airport and took the bus to Torshavn, where we had booked the cheapest car available. A VW Up! Just the idea of being free to do whatever you want, whenever you want it without being dependent on bus timings is in itself a blessing.",
                    "Plus I am a huge fan of driving. And the roads there are very well connected with little to no traffic. It's waiting to be explored! I don't think we would have seen some of the places if we were relying on public transport.",
                    "If you could PM me the Airbnb and where you rented the car from that would be really helpful! Appreciate that.",
                    "Sure, done.",
                    "Hi, could you forward these details to me as well?",
                    "Done. Let me know if you need any further details.",
                    "Thank you so much for this.. I'm visiting the islands between the 5th and 10th of November and I just want to gather all the information I can to make it a memorable stay... I currently have a reservation at Sandavágur.. Would you recommend staying for the duration of the trip at Sandavágur and travelling every day to other islands or should I split my stay between torshavn and Sandavágur?",
                    "You won't have any problems, distance-wise, to travel everyday to other islands. I'm not sure what Sandavagur is like, when it comes to restaurants. In Torshavn, there were quite a few options to choose from, when it comes to drinks and meals in the evenings.",
                    "You should also consider the toll for the two tunnels that connect the islands. If you are leaving Vagar everyday of your stay, that's a fair bit of money that you can save by staying in Torshavn.",
                    "If you are ok with the above, then I don't see why you need to change your existing bookings. I have never been to Sandavagur, just drove thru it. So I don't know much about it.",
                    "Do you mind sending me a PM with your airbnb recommendation as well? I'm going in August. Do you feel like Torshavn was the best place to make home base?",
                    "I'll send the PM. Yes, Torshavn might be the only good place for tourists considering the various hotel and restaurant options available. No matter which island you are on, you are never too far away from Torshavn. You can always head back at the end of the day.",
                    "You might also want to look at staying in Klaksvik, if you want to spend more time exploring the islands in the east. Seemed like a cute little town worth staying at. But we didn't do that.",
                    "You can check my comment on this thread for an alternate perspective. Personally, having multiple 'bases' allowed me to further explore specific areas since I never had to go all the way back to one certain area (less of a time crunch).",
                    "Renting a car was definitely worth it when I was there as well. If you ever go back, check out the Airbnb on Nolsoy which is very close to Torshavn.",
                    "Hitchhiking can get you far, but of course it's risky as you might not get picked up at all. I personally always pick up hitchhikers, and go out of my way to get them where they need to go, but I've also heard stories from people who have been waiting for hours, and not have a single car stopping to offer them a lift.",
                    "If I were you, I would consider having renting a car for part of your stay, to get you to the most remote places, and where the public transport isn't well connected. Yes, it is expensive, but well worth it.",
                    "I had to hitchhike back to my car, after a 10km hike where I ended up on a different part of the island. Was a very different experience as I have never hitchhiked in my life, and I had no other choice as there were no public transport on that route.",
                    "Had to take 3 different cars to get where I wanted. Didn't wait for too long. I probably flagged around 15 cars before one stopped. So not too bad IMO.",
                    "If you end up choosing Airbnb over tenting (although tenting would be preferable in my eyes as well), I can suggest a few. One other commenter slept in Torshavn the whole time, which does work quite well. During my 7 day trip in March 2017, I stayed on three different islands and would strongly recommend that, although I did have a rental car. It allows for more exploration in specific areas since a person doesn't have to worry about transport back to one location every time.",
                    "I stayed on Vagar, Nolsoy, and Eysturoy. My name on Airbnb is Keith Wuest, maybe you can look up the locations on my profile? The family on Nolsoy is so friendly and the small restaurant on the island has a great atmosphere.. I cannot remember the name of it.",
                    "I used the Vagar Airbnb to explore that island and the host directed me to a lesser known trail and lake that was lovely. The Nolsoy Airbnb was for exploration on that island and for my time in Torshavn. The Eysturoy Airbnb was for my northern island travels (Bordoy, Kalsoy, and Vidoy).",
                    "Writing this is bringing back all of the memories.. That trip was truly an amazing experience. I am so excited for you! I'm sure my Airbnbs are not necessarily better than other choices but I do know these hosts would aid in providing you with an even better experience. No matter what you choose to do in terms of accommodation, be ready for a really unique time."

Just DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE WINDS .I spent 3 weeks there. Public transport that includes ferries (except to mykinnes) is amazing. You need special tickets to mykinnes. Otherwise the busses and ferries are perfect to all islands. These 4 day tickets with unlimited hop on and off is the way to go. I always made back to Torshavn except when I was up north at klaksvik. Try airbnb. Otherwise. Enjoy the stay and the islands.",

Is there a restaurant in Torshavn or elsewhere where we have a better chance of finding this on the menu? I see on Raest's website they currently have the Pilot Whale on their menu, but I don't know if that will be true in May also. We will be renting a car and driving around as much of the country as we can, so could really eat anywhere, but our base will be in Torshavn right by the harbor.",

                    "It's been a lifelong dream of mine to visit the Faroe Islands and I am finally thinking of going this summer with my toddler and husband. We live in central Europe and do not own a car and we greatly prefer to utilize public transit, walking and biking when we travel. Would we be able to see some sights on the Faroe Islands and take a few hikes without renting a car? We'd be open to taking an occasional taxi, but I'm wondering if it's do-able to spend several days just using public transit, ferries, etc.",
                    "Would require some planning, but is doable. Utilise the heli service as well, as it’s relatively cheap. There’s options for tourists at SSL.fo - some cards you can buy and use transport as you see fit. Always make plan A & B due to weather",
                    "As mentioned this will require a lot more planning on your part. You can get to most places easily for example Kallur Lighthouse (ferry from klaksvík and connecting bus to and from Trøllanes), Kirkjubø (Almost hourly free bus from Tórshavn), Nólsoy (cheap ferry from Tórshavn) etc.",
                    "Some places might be harder to get to for example Gásadalur. Unfortunately you can not book return flights on the same day by helicopter so you will either need to stay there a day or take the ferry (For example Mykines) but I would definitely recommend you take a look at tyrla.atlantic.fo and ssl.fo and also rib62.com for sightseeing.",

With this approach public transport works perfectly fine.",

If I'm staying in Tórshavn, will I be able to make it to the airport using public transport in time for the 8:00AM flight? Other than public transport, what would be my best way to get back to the airport in time for the early flight?",
                    "I will be renting a car during my stay, but would like to have the last couple of days to explore Tórshavn on foot. I will most likely return the car a couple days before my flight to save money.",

                    "Hey everyone, I'm planning on visiting the Islands during the second week of May and was debating between spending 1 week or 2 weeks here. I plan on renting an Airbnb along with a car, and want to do lots of hiking, naturally!",
                    "Nope. I spent a week there several years ago and was only able to explore Streymoy and Esturoy (and not those as thoroughly as I would have liked). Several trips can have weather complications (Mykines and the eastern islands, if I recall correctly) so you might have to wait for a good window. Two weeks would give you time to relax and see all the things you want to see.",
                    "Yes Mykines is a place which is not always available. But i wish it was, its magnificent.",
                    "Exactly. I did not get to visit, but talked to another traveler that had and heard great stories. I'll be back sometime to see more of what the Islands have to offer!",
                    "I recommend taking a helicopter instead of a boat.",
                    "Or both. By helicopter in, by boat out. In hindsight, I found the ride much more impressive than the flight (the first lasts 45 mins, the other only 6).",
                    "True",
                    "Hey,",
                    "I'm coming to the faore islands in may, and would like to check out mykines (weather permitting). I understand that you have to have a guide. Do know of a guide that you would recommend? I'm have a hard time finding any reviews on guides.",
                    "Not at all... it's just the perfect amout of time to absorb everything that the nature and people have to offer at faroes.",

Several trips can have weather complications (Mykines and the eastern islands, if I recall correctly) so you might have to wait for a good window.

                    "In it a bunch of students were apparently on a graduation party, all of them using a cap and typical clothes (dresses for girls and jackets for boys). I have seen this type of clothing during Ólavsøka, but I didn't know people dressed like that outside of the 29th of July. What are these garments called? When are they supposed to be used?",
                    "There’s not really any rules. I don my búna whenever there’s reason to celebrate. Weddings, any party where I don’t expect to be drunk as a skunk or if the choir I’m in decides to suit up. If at wedding, I make sure not to wear same colour vest as the groom.",
                    "at a wedding if donning Føroysk klæði the groom is supposed to wear a white vest and white socks. On the opposing side a widower is supposed to wear a black/blue hat, black vest and reddish-brown (morreyðar) socks.",
                    "I have attended weddings where the groom wore red. It’s really a personal choice. If I ever made the poor decision on marrying, I’d probably not wear white, simply because it’s a one time wear vest for a fair amount of money. The blue posahúgva is not only for widdowers, albeit it’s common",
                    "Priests and old men in general have been known to wear them. My great grandfather, who was the gravedigger in Tórshavn (some decades ago), had two, the red one he used when working, but when attending the funerals he is said to have worn his blue one.",

                    "Is it a closed/open syllable thing? Just random variation? Me mishearing? I MUST KNOW",
                    "Great question. I'm using Kristján Árnason's book The Phonology of Icelandic and Faroese as a guide. Firstly, you are hearing this mostly right, but rather than [tʃ] it is actually [tʃʰ] (this is important because there is a fortis-lenis opposition in Faroese and Icelandic using aspiration). I'm not sure it has much to do with the syllable structure. He gives an example of hjóla 'wheel' which has the same onset as hjá and is closed like hjálpa.",
                    "I would think it could be influence of Modern Danish hjælpe, but Árnason notes this pronunication goes back to Middle Faroese. As /u/Tidligare suggests, this could have to do with word frequency, where the rule seems to have been palatalization of velar stops bordering /j/ (fricative onsets seem to have often become stops in Faroese), but resulted in deletion of /h/ in less frequent words. I would support the former claim by comparing Icelandic, where /hj/ has become realized as [ç].",
                    "EDIT: Wrote this pretty early in the morning and just realized hjóla actually consists of two open syllables, so I’m curious as to whether you’re onto something with the syllable.",
                    "So more frequent words use [tʃʰ], and less frequent ones us [j]?",
                    "Possibly, but that's certainly not a verified truth. For example, I notice the named Hjalmar, which, correct me if I'm wrong, is a somewhat common name in the Faroe Islands, is pronounced with [j]. I'm curious as to how many words that historically had an /hj/ onset are now only pronounced [j]. From all the examples I could find, it's mostly [tʃʰ].",

We are going to stay in Torshavn, but would like to see some of your nature as well, but the trouble is that none of us have driving licenses. Where do we go or what do we do if we want to find someone local who wants to show us around on the islands? (Compensation included, of course)",
                    "The national bus and ferry system is good, except for weekends, so check the schedule: www.ssl.fo. It's often easy to take the bus for the outbound leg and hitch-hike back to Tórshavn.",

Getting a ride is a question of patience (since there are few cars) and visibility, but not a matter of a lack of goodwill! I hope that you plan a stay of at least three days; two isn't a lot. On your way from the airport to Tórshavn, if you do this by taxi, you can ask them to make a detour here and there at an extra charge. Use every minute of your time!",

                    "There's a dedicated parking area close to the houses. 62°06'37.6\"N 7°26'13.0\"W You can park there and walk to the viewpoint.",
                    "Thank you!",

                    "I only asked because I read on the parking rules that you can't park in a lay-by, I think it was called? So I got curious! We would go this way right after landing at the airport and then head on to Torshavn in the early evening. :)"
