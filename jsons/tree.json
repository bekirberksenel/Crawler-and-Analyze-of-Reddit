                    "Hello all! So I used to be a pretty avid smoker. Daily, wake up, go to work, go to bed, whatever the occasion i was lighting a J. So fast forward i got into some heavier substances and went to rehab in February of 2016. Was sober for 2 years & decided to smoke a nut with my boyfriend, just to see how I would feel. Well, it was fun for about 6 minutes and then I felt the most extreme paranoia I have ever felt. And like I said, I was into some heavier shit. My heart was goin a million a minute and I was not enjoying my time. I took the roach outside and buried it in the pouring rain and then sat in the shower, fetal position for 2 hours. Tried to go to sleep, and was so anxious i couldn’t even close my eyes for more than 3 seconds. Now that was not fun.",
                    "Moral of this post, can someone maybe direct me in a way of getting okay with puffing on a j every once in a while again? I just want to relax. Help me please !! Any advice is good advice. Thanks!",

The best assessment I can give so far is that it appears to be a liriodendron species with either some kind of mutation or environmental factor causing the leaves to be malformed. The liriodendron genus includes the north American and the Chinese tulip tree species.",
                    "Haha...stumping me. Didn't even realize I did that. In any case I'm going to branch out in my research and perhaps go out on a limb to get to the root of this.",
                    "The thing is that tulip tree flowers have a lot more going on in the middle, more anthers, are orange, etc.; it is possible that it's just a different cultivar, but I'm not sure?",
                    "The only other liriodendron cultivar besides tulipifera that I know of is chinense, which doesn't match this either. It's a freak!",
                    "That just makes it unique!",
                    "Oh ya, special little guy. Have you been able to find anything outside the liriodendron genus that this might fit into? Never had this much trouble id'ing a tree.",
                    "I'm stumped. Whenever I can't id a tree/plant, I try an app, but that an't helping",
                    "Same here.  But I'm now thinking this is a magnolia acuminata variant. Still can't pin it down though.",
                    "Sorry I didn’t get a close up. I don’t usually take pictures of trees so I didn’t think to get a good shot of the leaves."

                    "That's an oak tree seedling that forgot what it was doing. For some reason it is not producing chlorophyll. It will not survive very long like that since it can not produce food for itself in the long run. It's surviving now off the energy that was in the seed.",
                    "Is that at all common?",
                    "It's common enough but usually you wouldn't see it because the plant doesn't live very long. Once it runs out of energy that was stored in the seed it will need to produce its own food but can't so usually die in a few weeks to a month.",
                    "On our nursery in a batch of 10,000 oaks we might get 2-3. They are beautiful while they last.",
                    "That's fascinating! Do you work for a nursery? Do any other plants experience this phenomenon? Would it be possible to feed them something to extend their lifespan?",
                    "Yes I own a nursery. We grow a lot of native trees from seed so it's something that we see from time to time.",
                    "So other plants do have this happen. The reason you can see an oak like this is because the seed is large and stored a lot of food for the plant to establish. Other seeds typically that are smaller will die faster because they don't have that stockpile of food.",
                    "You would have a hard time feeding it to keep it alive like this since it wouldn't be able to convert the food without sunlight for energy. There are however versions of plants that are variegated which means it has a white or off white boarder to the leaf and because the whole leaf is not white it's still able to produce enough energy to sustain itself. They do tend to grow slower than versions of the same plant that are not variegated.",
                    "That's super interesting. Thanks for the info!"
