                    "Many Nigerians and africans do not know that the knowledge systems of Ifa and Voodo, divination in general are the basis of computer science. The fundemental mathematics that creates computers Boolean algebra and logic comes from these traditions. It was introduced into Europe by our cousins from Mali, Burkina Faso, and Morroco where Charles Boole first wrote his thesis on the matter in the 1700's (i think this is the correct century). Is this being taught in Nigeria? I find it very troubling how we tend to throw away our history and fetishize white european and white arab customs.",
                    "Sources?",
                    "I cannot link them right now. But google Ifa and Computer science. There are two papers on this matter. One is from the 1970' and comes from the University of California and describes the math behind Ifa. Another one is from an Afican man studying computers in Africa at University. Dr. Ron Eglash professor of Mathematics in rhe USA in his book \"African Fractals\" touches on how the math behind computers comes from west africa and made its way into Europe during the 1700's.",
                    "https://youtu.be/7n36qV4Lk94 - here is a TED talk describing what I am talking about from Dr.Eglash.",
                    "u/Keita_Diop_33 this is fascinating and I think teaching school children about how abstract mathematics manifests itself in the physical realm is interesting but you and Dr. Eglash are guilty of the same thing trying to turn something that is universal into something that is unique to Africans. If you study enough African villages you're bound to observe some that exhibit fractal properties, this doesn't mean that we understand fractals, it's just something that is, the same way that a snail does not understand the Fibonacci sequence because it carries it up and down on it's back (in its shell). I understand the need for Africans to want to make a narrative for ourselves that is more complex than singing and dancing but that doesn't mean we should go about spouting falsehoods like Africans invented computer science (notice he did not mention Ifa once so I really don't know where you're getting your stuff from). The inventors of modern day computer science were inspired by ideas that (may) have their roots in or use the same logic as African divination that doesn't mean that African divination is not bullshit.",
                    "Look, if you studied African arts and crafts, music and dances you would notice complex patterns in them, that doesn't make the people who made them mathematicians, it makes them human, the world is beautiful and human beings pull out motifs from it all the time, trial and error and a whole lot of free time can make anybody come up with something magnificent. We don't need to clutch at straws to develop pride in Africa, we don't need someone telling us that the way we build our houses or plait our hair has some fractal properties to feel pride as Africans. We didn't invent computer science or most of mathematics as it is currently practised and that's okay. We don't need to start making false correlations so we can feel like we did something too. This man's video reeks of that fetishisation of Africa only people who don't live here are capable of. I don't understand his point some things in African art have fractal patterns, so? If he wants to help African, Native and Hispanic kids get better at maths help with funding for their maths teachers and libraries don't come with \"Your ancestors used to build mud houses with fractals in them so if you look at pictures of cornrows you'll get better at maths\" please, fuck off. Fractals are pretty, some houses have them, there is no TED talk here. Keita you don't have to make false correlations or clutch at straws to make your argument that Africans are as smart as whites, we didn't invent a lot of things and that's okay we're just as smart and talented as Asians, whites or whoever, whether our ancestors can prove it or not doesn't matter. Africa is not more magic or more close to nature than anywhere else.",
                    "You did not listen to Dr.Eglash. He even made sure that your line of thinking was criticized and he explicitly says that the people doing to fractals KNOW the math behind it and know exactly what they are doing. Its not random. If you have ever gotten a reading from a babalawo they will tell you what is going on. Dr. Eglash stated in the Charles Boole's thesis (which is the basis for western comp sci) he directly cited that he got his work from Arabic geomancy which is what the Europeans called african divination. We invented a whole lot of shit that the world uses but you need to do more reading.",
                    "Yeah, I had a feeling you wouldn't understand my point. You know what, fine Africans invented computer science, Africans invented Boolean algebra, Africans invented Artificial intelligence in fact Africans invented KFC! I rest my case.",
                    "No, I get your point. Dr.Eglash refuted that point in the first 5 minutes when he tested them on whether these fractals and boolean operations were simply intution or conscious descisions. They knew exactly what they were doing and even had to explain to a math professor on how to solve some of the recursion formulas. I dont understand why some africans get offended when you bring them information such as this. To think you know more than a Dr of mathematics on something he personally researched is hilarious.",

                    "\"...The present paper aims to view formal mathematics through the interpretation of Yoruba sky knowledge. It attempts to demonstrate that linguistic codes elaborated from the Yoruba conception of the sky are binary and hexadecimal codes that imply Algebraic Boolean structure or Group Structure. The system is in accord with classical mathematical properties of Group Structure. Finally, the review and interpretation of Yoruba cosmology may suggest the possibility of formal reasoning without any writing system in human history. The problem that has always been raised is that of knowing if symbols and configurations in the Yoruba interpretation of the sky are the result of implicit premeditated mathematical development. It is clear that behind the implicit oral discourse described hereafter lies a corresponding semiology elaborated with the corresponding formal mathematical reasoning that we claim.\"",

                    "Yoruba history is based on oral traditions. Knowledge is passed down generations not from written texts, but from simple word of mouth. This presents a fundamental problem; namely the simple fact that most of this knowledge is subject to modification and rearrangement over the years. Because Orunmila or Sango never wrote any books, we will never know for sure what they really did, or what they were thinking when they did what they did. When people tell stories, they narrate from the well of their own knowledge, which is always far from perfect. If you have played the game of telephone, I am sure it is very obvious to you how this can be an issue.",

                    "I have taken a look at Tunde Adegbola. He is not really a professor. He has no tenured academic positions. He has a doctorate in information science, and as far as I have researched, I don't believe he has published any peer-reviewed research articles. He has no publications in his field, or on this particular subject no less. This point is important because it is usually through the body of work of a scientist/researcher that we are best able to gauge the rigor with which they have analyzed and prepared their positions. We can take a look at his research and see if indeed he took the time to gather evidence and conducted the right experiments, and came to his conclusions only after a clearly outlined methodical study. Dr. Adegbola does not have any of this. Instead, it seems Dr. Adegbola has chosen to perform his studies at the level of a layman (in spite of his doctorate). He supports his positions by drawing from his experiences as a teenager learning about \"Ifa\" in high school. He does not provide concrete supporting evidence for any of his claims. Science is a very precise endeavor. One of the main tenets of the scientific process is that experiments be reproducible and falsifiable before they can be passed as law, or taken as fact. I would expect Dr. Adegbola to know this seeing as he has an actual Ph.D. There is no scientific process that can be identified as he attempts to make his claims. I may be wrong here but you will have to provide proof to the contrary of my claims.",
                    "Divination is not science: As stated above, science is a very exact and methodical venture. Before you can make a claim to a fact, It must be ascertained that this fact cannot be refuted by any of the methods known that may be used to refute it. It must be reproducible, and it must be falsifiable. The last point is very important as this is how we know when we have reached the truth. Something is said to be true if we have exhausted all means available for trying to prove that it is false.",
                    "Now, back to Ifa. If I met an Ifa priest today, and I asked that Ifa priest to write down for me, in a step by step manner, how he is able to use his cowry shells, and mentation beads to predict whether the unborn child of a psychiatric patient will become the president one day, do you suppose he will be able to do so. How about if I ask that he use his beads and calabash and effigies to predict in explicit detail what will happen to me tomorrow as soon as I wake from bed, and he write it down for me? What do you suppose he will tell me? If you anything about babalawos and Ifa priests, you will know that the answer to that question is hell no. They can't do it, because they know there is no patternality to what they do. In other words, their work is not truly reproducible.",
                    "Now, what if I said, that the Ifa priest should show me the way to do what he does so that I can show it to my friends and test it on my own. So that I can analyze it and test it in any scenario that I can think of, and prove to myself that this method of analyzing the world can be relied on. I am trying to test falsifiability here. Again, his answer will probably be a convoluted no. The Ifa priest will refuse to teach me because he knows that I am not a true believer.",

I may show you the tires are flat, o I may pull out a gauge that measures tire pressure and show you the numbers. You may choose to press me further on my purported knowledge, and then I then go into book mode and try to teach you all about charles law, and boyles law and how they apply here. I may show you scientific research that shows the connection between low tire pressure and accident rates.",

                    "Dr. Adegbola makes a lot of claims about how Ifa is a system of philosophy and science. This is inherently false at its core. Saying divination is science is like saying palm readers are scientists. Anyone who thinks about this knows this. I am not sure why you choose to go down this line. Just because there are some notable correlates between elements of divinity and the aspect of computer science, does not mean there is any method to their discovery, nor does that in itself serve as evidence of creation or invention by the former. Correlation is not the same as causation. I cannot say for instance that because Indians invented the numerical symbols we use, therefore, they invented algebra, or game theory. Nor can I say that because the Chinese were the first to discover gun powder, therefore they also invented the AK 47, or the howitzer. This is pure baldadash, and it should be treated as such.",

The esoteric system of Ifa is ORGANIZED by mathematics. Please read this multiple times. In order to give a reading the babalawo must cast his cowrie and read the BINARY digits and interperate them. I added professor Adgebola's video to give context to what DR. EGLASH professor of Mathematics and the paper from UC santa barbara are saying.

                    "Hey reddit. One of my close friends is Nigerian but is living here (NZ) for university. He gets quite homesick and I wanted to make his favourite dish (jollof rice) for his birthday. He's been trying to make it here for a while, but apparently can't get the rice consistency or the spices right. Could someone give me their best Nigerian jollof rice recipe so I can try to make it for his birthday? Any help would be appreciated.",

As for the spices, you really shouldn't add too many since you aren't very skilled yet. Not knowing what spices to mix and in what quantity can take away the savory richness of the jollof rice.Stick to the simple recipes and practice the cook in small batches before his big day. Do this and you will be well prepared for the final cook.",
                    "It's the rice species that's the problem. Buhari recently upped taxes on on imported rice and forced the development of proper rice farms and infrastructure.

This caused the Asian farms to start cutting down production and less stores carry the strain in their industry.",
                    "What makes oryza glaberrima special is it's ability to hold its shape after long cooking. This is crucial for jollof rice, no other strain can hold up after the 30 mins of constant cooking.",

                    "Most people will say Nigerians are very arrogant towards blacks in america and the carribean. Some Nigerian banker told me Haitiains deserved the hurricanes that devasted the country around 2 years ago because they practice voodoo (he was christian). When people find out I have Nigerian relatives they get really surprised that I dont act arrogant and elitist. Also, many Nigerians say that other blacks \"dont work hard enough in america\", but my rebuttal is always why are you here if Nigeria is so great and all these other people are below you?",
                    "Diop? Are you Senegalese? As an American born with a Nigerian parent, I will say that Nigerians definitely don't regard African Americans highly because of their conduct in certain situations. There are stereotypes about African Americans that are stemmed in real life and I think that Nigerians are appalled by these behaviours because they think anyone born in America has such a great opportunity to do well for themselves, unlike Nigerians who have to hustle hard, not because of racism (which Nigerians don't really experience as much as tribalism if anything) but because of a terribly run society/government... I believe Nigerians need to become more accountable for the country, but many Nigerians, I think, approach it as something that is broken and can't be fixed easily but it can be \"replaced\" in a way by emigration. Again, I was born n here so it's hard to say, but this is what I have observed. Secondly, Ethiopians act superior as hell. The rest of Africa looks humble in comparison imho. And finally, this is behaviour that I see with most Africans except the ones who try really hard to be like Americans, and even they will talk about black Americans like second-tier negroes. Hope that helps.",
                    "No, I am not Senegalese. My line comes from Nigeria. I just really like Senegal and the people and I study Chiek Anta Diop's work on africa.",
                    "Cool.",
                    "Hi there. This is interesting to read. Is tribalism in Nigeria really worse than racism in the US? And do 2nd generation African immigrants born in the US not consider themselves among the Afroamerican cultural group?",
                    "From what I understand tribalism isn't worse, but it's present. It's more like giving your Chilean customer a discount because they're your fellow countryman (lol what if you're actually Slavic) Vs anyone else who comes shopping today, I guess. It can be harmful, but it's also human nature... I can't speak for all 1st gen African Americans because we're all unique. Some that I've known feel as I do and some, a few I've known would disagree. Each case is peculiar and for me, it's only recently that I've started to strongly identify as an African African even though I was born and raised here. I just called myself black because my father is African American and my mother is African, so black is accurate but it doesn't tie me down to here or there. My parents got divorced when I was young and my dad being a stereotypical black male really hasn't been in my life for the past decade or so, so I've been raised primarily by an African. I identified very strongly with my Igbo culture more than my American culture. Having moved around a bunch as a kid I also don't have very strong ties to any particular group of people. Growing up most of my friends were first generation Americans from Asia and Africa, and we shared many things in common despite our different ethnicities. On the other hand, I didn't have many friends who were African American or even white American (but more of my friends were white than black American). I think there is a cultural divide between myself self and most generational African Americans I've met. There are different expectations at home, different behaviours, different outlooks, and even different perceptions. There is a negative stereotype that hangs over African Americans that I can't shake in my mind, and as I've come to accept my African AMERICAN identity, I've put in a greater effort to shed the mindset that I grew up having, viewing black Americans as the ones most likely to commit crimes then blame it on systematic racism and such... Honestly, there are things I admire about Africans that I don't see in African Americans, and there are things I admire about African American that I don't see in Africans, and the same goes for bad things. But there is a difference. I find it hard to place my identity in one group or another but whether I like it or not, I am African American. That's only made harder to say because growing up I liked things that aren't common among black people e.g. scramo music. I didn't listen to much rap and hip hop until recently and I didn't get the cultural  references  that they have, as a result. Things like that make me look like an anomaly to both Africans (screamo is freaking crazy to most people) and African Americans. But I must say, I never feel more alone than when I'm surrounded by a bunch of African Americans (who aren't at a nerd con) or a bunch of white people (who aren't a rock concert). So that's where I stand, but everyone is different. Edit: spelling",
                    "Pretty interesting. Thanks very much! And yes, I am Chilean :) But live in Chile",
                    "Well I guess if you didn't give an Argentinian a discount. But no problem.",
                    "I dont identify with my parents' culture besides the superficial things (food, clothes, etc), i dont identify with AA 's completely because of my upbringing. I grew up around black people though, went to a 97 percent black high school. All my friends are black (AA, Jamaican, Haitain, etc) so I know blacks from all over the diaspora. Racism >>>>> tribalism. I dont even know if some of these tribal conflicts would even exist without racism/colonization",
                    "I think tribalism would exist in any case. People are prejudice period. The less you share in common, the less you tend to agree with and respect each other. There is tribalism everywhere. It's sad, but I don't think it's going anywhere.",
                    "Both Nigerians and Black Americans are arrogant I their own way. Nigerians want to prosper for economic success. Black Americans want an equal society without racial discrimination. Heck even among Black Americans they don’t support each other. For instance in Atlanta, High earning Blacks don’t care about/resent other Blacks from rural/ghetto areas. Some will even despise you if you hang out with Whites often. Vice versa for Nigerians that condemn Blacks on Welfare etc. Bottom line, people just relate to others that are in their own situation. In any negro society you find yourself in, diaspora or homeland. There is going to be arrogance or condemnation of some kind for being like this or that. You just have to find people like you that share your values. Hopefully it favours good life for you.  Use your common sense, you know the default disciplines in today’s world. (Hint: it has nothing to do with blacks)",
                    "Because coming from Nigeria they know what a true shitty government is and the shithole it creates. Nigerians are just as \"Black\" as African Americans yet the outcome between each groups are vastly different Overseas. In America at least, they are the most educated and earn more on average than white Americans, in the UK they have started to outscore the native whites there on stadardized exans. It's just hard to consistently cry racism like Black Americans when the same countries have offered you an escape from Nigeria. They don't understand why Blacks are doing drugs, killing each other, not graduating high school, lazy, etc with the opportunities they (in comparison to Nigeria). You can't help but feel that you are different from these groups of people. This difference between the cultures is why the educational and financial disparity between the two groups are so great. As for Nigeria being so \"great\", it is a great country is certain aspects but it's really the cultures that are great more than anything else. Every Nigerian is tired of the corruption and living conditions.",
                    "You won't get this same type of feeling from those living in Nigeria because they haven't experienced African American culture or American opportunities yet. They only see what's trending on social media. It's at the point where African American culture has had influence on Nigerian culture. So I wouldnt say all Nigerians behave that way because a lot of them are the exact opposite.",
                    "Finally someone with the guts to admit it!",
                    "Yea but if were being honest.... if the average nigerian came to america they would be broke and poor as shown by the state Nigeria is in. The laws of physics work the same in Nigeria and The USA.",
                    "I feel like that really depends on the ethnic group. Not to be \"tribalistic\" but for example the igbos average the highest test scores in the UK more so than UK natives where as say the Fulani are not as culturally indulged in education or learning. I don't have any numbers off hand but the igbos make up a small percentage of Nigerians yet have a decent sized population of high earners overseas. It's reasonable to say the non educated or lower intelligent ones are left in Nigeria along with intelligent ones who haven't left. If brought into America I think most Nigerians (barring the Fulani) would atleast take advantage, even if it's just driving a taxi.",
                    "All they do is complain and complain about complete non-issues, try to control how africans think, call themselves \"African Americans\" when they're clearly just Americans, post racist rubbish on twitter(lol wyt ppl amirite) then complain about racist rubbish because they're oppressed or something then try to lecture me on how much better I have it in \"Africa\" while they're suffering in a country where all  basic human needs are met and free speech exists, not to mention the shit smug attitude they all seem to have(have you seen r/blackfellas or r/blackpeopletwitter? nutters).",
                    "I don't know what you mean and you are proving the point I am making. There are cities in America where african americans have to drink lead water. So no they are not complaining about \"non-issues\". Africans have whole countries with oil, gold, diamonds, silver, native languages, native crops but for some reason some africans have this aversion to other blacks in america and the carribean. African americans literally protested south african apartheid and were the MAIN driving force in america against white minority rule. Also, african americans and caribbeans were the ones who organized the pan-african congress that saw Nkurmah, Kenyatta, and other africab leaders come together and plan the end of colonial occupation.",
                    "I don't dislike carribbean people, or black people who aren't Africans, just the yanks. Of course they did good things decades years ago but these are quite clearly not the same people, if you don't believe this just look at their reactions to the persecution of whites in south Africa, they directly oppose the ideals of their \"heroes\"(Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and blacks who fought against segregation in the US) the black Americans of 2018* are not the black Americans of 1967",
                    "Ok... good luck man. I hear africans complain daily. Sucking up to Europeans and Chinese isnt doing much for africans.",
                    "you're attitude is shit, you aren't much better to what you hate.",
                    "Many Nigerians are illiterate. Alot of us aren't smart enough to engage in global politics, especially the older ones. Many believe the most insane conspiracy theories. But the same goes for everyone in the world, there are more stupid people. By showing of your global consciousness you disprove the stereotype that it's all Nigerians",
                    "True, guess I just have to keep doing my part. It just gets weird because I rather not have bad interactions with people based on how other nigerians treated them.",
                    "It pisses me off when Nigerians who live abroad say that blacks in America don't work hard enough. Like you're coming from a place where you didn't face systemic oppression and likely had a higher social standing in Nigeria than the African-Americans have in America and you come and declare them lazy instead of finding creative ways to support their community (or at the very least keep your mouth shut). They'll now buy into the racist narratives that whites concocted, some will even go as far as saying \"I'm from Africa, I'm not like those other blacks\" we blacks need to support each other not antagonize one another when we come in contact.",
                    "That said in my opinion this behaviour can be chalked up to an attitude shared by most (not all) Nigerians. Were fairly arrogant people by nature we like material things and don't practice tact when we speak, lack critical thinking skills and are judgemental as fuck. All this mixed together will make a pretty nasty superiority complex. Whenever African-Americans ask you about this make sure you tell them that not all Nigerians are like this and that you support their community whole heartedly. You must never separate Africans from the Diasporans if you truly love Africa.",
                    "Thank you for this 😢. Funny thing is most Nigerians/Africans would be surprised by how much AA's and other blacks in general show them respect. When I think of real african history and the volumes upon volumes of books I have read... majority were pretty much all made by blacks in the west.",
                    "Really? Are they? Thought it was the other way round.",
                    "Not even. You know I have had Nigerians laugh at slavery of blacks in the carribbean and america? Calling ppl akata's, ghetto, un-cultured (while they wear blonde wigs and speak english), it reeks of jealously.",
                    "IMO Africans and Americans face different issues. Africans may start off poor but their parents are highly educated and push their children. Years of racism means that black Americans have poor uneducated parents who are more likely to push them.",
                    "Africans often don't see this and think rascism is purely direct. To some extent they also are less disheartened by it after all they aren't American. They expect to be treated differently but as foreigners.",
                    "Yea, i've seenca few africans get that wake up call in the states. What is funny is that the racists make fun of africa all the time. So i see africans siding with racists because they talk about american blacks yet dont know that these racists see africans as idiots incapable of governing themselves."

It's more like giving your Chilean customer a discount because they're your fellow countryman (lol what if you're actually Slavic) Vs anyone else who comes shopping today, I guess. It can be harmful, but it's also human nature... I can't speak for all 1st gen African Americans because we're all unique. Some that I've known feel as I do and some, a few I've known would disagree. Each case is peculiar and for me, it's only recently that I've started to strongly identify as an African African even though I was born and raised here. I just called myself black because my father is African American and my mother is African, so black is accurate but it doesn't tie me down to here or there. My parents got divorced when I was young and my dad being a stereotypical black male really hasn't been in my life for the past decade or so, so I've been raised primarily by an African. I identified very strongly with my Igbo culture more than my American culture. Having moved around a bunch as a kid I also don't have very strong ties to any particular group of people. Growing up most of my friends were first generation Americans from Asia and Africa, and we shared many things in common despite our different ethnicities. On the other hand, I didn't have many friends who were African American or even white American (but more of my friends were white than black American). I think there is a cultural divide between myself self and most generational African Americans I've met. There are different expectations at home, different behaviours, different outlooks, and even different perceptions. There is a negative stereotype that hangs over African Americans that I can't shake in my mind, and as I've come to accept my African AMERICAN identity, I've put in a greater effort to shed the mindset that I grew up having, viewing black Americans as the ones most likely to commit crimes then blame it on systematic racism and such... Honestly, there are things I admire about Africans that I don't see in African Americans, and there are things I admire about African American that I don't see in Africans, and the same goes for bad things. But there is a difference. I find it hard to place my identity in one group or another but whether I like it or not, I am African American. That's only made harder to say because growing up I liked things that aren't common among black people e.g. scramo music. I didn't listen to much rap and hip hop until recently and I didn't get the cultural  references  that they have, as a result. Things like that make me look like an anomaly to both Africans (screamo is freaking crazy to most people) and African Americans. But I must say, I never feel more alone than when I'm surrounded by a bunch of African Americans (who aren't at a nerd con) or a bunch of white people (who aren't a rock concert). So that's where I stand, but everyone is different. Edit: spelling",

Vice versa for Nigerians that condemn Blacks on Welfare etc. Bottom line, people just relate to others that are in their own situation. In any negro society you find yourself in, diaspora or homeland. There is going to be arrogance or condemnation of some kind for being like this or that.

It's just hard to consistently cry racism like Black Americans when the same countries have offered you an escape from Nigeria. They don't understand why Blacks are doing drugs, killing each other, not graduating high school, lazy, etc with the opportunities they (in comparison to Nigeria). You can't help but feel that you are different from these groups of people. This difference between the cultures is why the educational and financial disparity between the two groups are so great. As for Nigeria being so \"great\", it is a great country is certain aspects but it's really the cultures that are great more than anything else.

                    "It’s not the issue of coming early or late, it’s that Nigeria should have never been amalgamated, Nigeria has and would always be split by tribe. If you look at every major crisis in Nigeria, it’s always been tribe motivated. Even choosing a president is ethnic motivated, the congress passing any legislation is ethnic motivated.",
                    "I think it came too early. Maybe if the British had remained for another 20 years we would have assimilated their maintenance culture and codes of ethics regarding corruption; although how ethical could people who barge in and subjugate natives for their own personal gain really be? And I remember reading somewhere that since that culture of plundering is what we natives were taught our leaders are just carrying it on. Maybe if they stayed longer it would have given us more reasons to work together between tribes to chase them out.  Also more of them would have settled permanently but they would certainly have turned into a permanent upper class like the whites in South Africa ( maybe not Apartheidy though). I think if the permanent upper class of white Nigerians remained here and ruled us they may have made better leaders than our current ones if only to make Nigeria a more comfortable place for themselves. This is all speculation though.",
                    "I think I understand  you... You mean if they have spent a lot of time in Nigeria... Different things would have been put in place, but just the little they put in place, we are still not utilizing them in a proper way.... Instead we still prefer things from the other world than our own things.... A good example is the issue of petroleum in Nigeria. Despite the fact that we own this thing ( oil)  we still sell to them at their own price and when they finish refining it... They sell back to us at their own rate again... When we lack to maintain the refineries  in our great country NIGERIA.",
                    "Too late. World war 1 would be the perfect time. It would have given enough space for the big tribes to become equal and eventually semi independent. We shouldn't have a single president, we should have a parliament or a triumvirate",

I can see people from minority tribes being sidelined by the bigger tribes clear as day. Let's just keep the seat of power central and make the best of this situation. Even if we devise the cleverest system of government that suits Nigeria perfectly it still won't remedy the people themselves being corrupt actors.",
                    "This HELPS the smaller tribes. Each of the big tribes only has at most 20% of the total population. That's 60% already. This guarantees that a big tribe will always sway the vote. But having more seats splits up the big tribes allowing the 40% to have a better chance.",
                    "So the distribution would be  2 big tribe votes for every 1 small tribe vote rather than the current 6 big tribe votes for every 4 small tribe votes.  There would be more competition as there are now different demographics to consider",
                    "I see your point now. I just wish people voted by values and ideas and not by tribal affiliation. All of this wouldn't even be a problem if peeps would just vote the right person into office regardless of tribe.",

                    "This is a tricky question. tricky because there are several advantages to colonization and disadvantages too.",

                    "If they had stayed longer, they would have gained access to our oil, they would have attempted to enrich themselves with it. They probably would never have left and treat Nigeria like SA where a white minority lives in luxury and controls the natural and human resources of the indigenous majority. But they would have developed the country. Infrastructure will be up to date, education, healthcare, welfare... you name it. Our standing in the world would have been better than it is now. Again, look at South Africa. Say what you want about what the whites did there, you can't deny that South Africa is the most developed African nation today. They hosted the world cup.",
                    "If the British had remained in Nigeria for longer, they would have likely treated us all the same. Tribalism would be replaced by racism or apartheid. It will no longer be Hausa vs Igbo, but white vs black."

Failing to actually capture what goes in Nigerian families, communities and institutions. It's all the same recycled storylines about marriages, relationships, aristos/sugar babies, kingship in rural settings and poor humour. While it is okay to focus on marriages and relationships, the stories all feel so tired and shallow. This is where I feel the Yoruba part of Nollywood excels greatly as their family dramas are actually more intriguing and complex.I know it's difficult considering the nature of our society, but I would love to see more on Nigerian history, more biopics, more complex crime dramas, more coming-of-age films and more movies in a political/bureaucratic setting.",

Most of them went on to get jobs in great companies. This guy Naija guy behind me had a 4.0 GPA 7 straight semesters, graduating after the 8th, idk what happened after I left. Anyway...do some of them ever return and use their skills there? What's the relationship between Nigeria and their diaspora? What's their effect on the economy?",
                    "Naming. How are people named? Some of the name are long, we just say obi, yemi etc, is it the same back home? Do Nigerians have difficulty with other Nigerian names?",
                    "Nigerians are your textbook overachievers. I think because of the shock of going from a country with few opportunities (Nigeria) to a place with myriad opportunities like the USA is a real driving force in our desire for success. Schooling in Nigeria is fairly difficult and I've heard that school in the USA is a walk in the park for most Nigerians. Although most Nigerians you meet abroad were upper middle-class or higher when they were back in Nigeria so maybe it's also a social mobility thing, where people in higher classes maintain their privilege through achievement. I don't know if our performance as a group would be so stellar if most of the Nigerians in America were sourced from the lowest classes. So our excellence might be more a socio-economic class thing than a Nigerian thing. A few of them do return and use their skills in Nigeria, but I'm not sure of the proportion of them, and more Nigerians are leaving than are coming back hence the brain drain, when they return they're usually lapped up by multinational corporations, there is big debate here about if IJGBs (I Just Got Backs) have an advantage here or not, I believe they do, some of them start businesses or other things, they're a pretty industrious group of people. Their relationship with Nigeria differs on a case by case basis. Some Nigerians living abroad are very close with their Nigerian relatives, visit every year, speak the languages and shuttle between Abroad and Nigeria often while some never visit and want nothing to do with Nigeria. Nigerians love our diasporans if we're a little jealous of them, some diasporans have a nasty superiority complex though and come back to Nigeria to rant about how much better they have it than us. The economy has benefited from the diaspora since many of them regularly send money back here some even do a bit of trading in things like Nigerian food or clothes or cheap hair extensions so they're good for the economy but any good they do is quickly negated by the corrupt government. What are the diasporans from Kenya like and what is their relationship with the homeland?",
                    "Naming ceremonies are very lavish celebrations in Nigeria done about a week after the child is born. The specifics differ from one tribe to another but it's usually a big party. Names in Nigeria are used to signify meaning and they're formed by connecting words that express an idea. So someone's name might translate to God loves me so much, Good tidings are following me, happy days have arrived, God will protect me forever, you get the idea. So I think that's why the names are so long, because they're conveying long and complex ideas. Most names have markers that will tell you what tribe the owner is, like the Yorubas often have Olu, Oluwa or Oba (which mean God although Oba technically means king but it's referring to God in this case) starting their names or emi (which means me i.e. the string of words and phrases before the 'emi' are referring to me.) at the end of their name. For example \"Oluwanifemi\" a Yoruba name, means Oluwa: God, nife:  has love for, emi: me. You also have \"Chi\" prefix for Igbo people as in Chidinma or Chinonso, \"Oghene\" prefix or suffix for Delta people as in Eseoghene or Oghenerugba or Osa prefix in Bini people as in Osarogwe or Osamuyi. It's all very long and complicated and I wouldn't finish today if I went into detail Nigeria had a LOT of tribes. In Nigeria you will likely come across two or three unpronounceable names in any given week. Most people provide a shortened form of their name for ease although some people will not, it is important to respect people's names. All you have to do is be patient, listen very well and put in effort into pronouncing correctly. Remember it's human beings that are speaking the language, not aliens, if you can learn to say Schwarzenegger you can learn to say any Nigerian name. I've never understood people who refuse to pronounce people's names correctly, like they're not asking you to learn the language they're asking you to learn ONE word. Nigerians have some difficulty with names of people outside their tribal group but it's nothing some effort, patience and good manners won't fix. How about Kenyan names tell me about them.",

I think because of the shock of going from a country with few opportunities (Nigeria) to a place with myriad opportunities like the USA is a real driving force in our desire for success. Schooling in Nigeria is fairly difficult and I've heard that school in the USA is a walk in the park for most Nigerians. Although most Nigerians you meet abroad were upper middle-class or higher when they were back in Nigeria so maybe it's also a social mobility thing, where people in higher classes maintain their privilege through achievement. I don't know if our performance as a group would be so stellar if most of the Nigerians in America were sourced from the lowest classes. So our excellence might be more a socio-economic class thing than a Nigerian thing. A few of them do return and use their skills in Nigeria, but I'm not sure of the proportion of them, and more Nigerians are leaving than are coming back hence the brain drain, when they return they're usually lapped up by multinational corporations, there is big debate here about if IJGBs (I Just Got Backs) have an advantage here or not, I believe they do, some of them start businesses or other things, they're a pretty industrious group of people. Their relationship with Nigeria differs on a case by case basis. Some Nigerians living abroad are very close with their Nigerian relatives, visit every year, speak the languages and shuttle between Abroad and Nigeria often while some never visit and want nothing to do with Nigeria. Nigerians love our diasporans if we're a little jealous of them, some diasporans have a nasty superiority complex though and come back to Nigeria to rant about how much better they have it than us. The economy has benefited from the diaspora since many of them regularly send money back here some even do a bit of trading in things like Nigerian food or clothes or cheap hair extensions so they're good for the economy but any good they do is quickly negated by the corrupt government. What are the diasporans from Kenya like and what is their relationship with the homeland?",

                    "During the last administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, there were so many flaws on his part, especially how he ran the security situation of the country. Under Jonathan’s watch, Boko Haram became the most notorious terrorist group in the world. It was under him that we had the Chibok girls kidnap situation which majority of security experts believed he handled carelessly.",
                    "Nigerians were very critical of Jonathan and the lackadaisical manner in which he ran the security situation of the country was one of the weapons the current APC government used in criticizing the then PDP government and it became one of their main campaign points. I was an everyday critic of Jonathan on many issues bordering Nigeria but I was soft on him when it came to security matters because even though he is the GCFR, he was still a civilian whom some would say became President by accident so I kinda pitied him, why? because he had no military background, no military training, no security skills, was a weak President who surrounded himself by “Yes men” which is one of the many reasons why he lost to Buhari in 2015, so basically he had absolutely nothing to prepare him for the big job ahead of him. Whenever my friends criticized Jonathan, I, for the most part, criticized those around him who were supposed to give him the proper advice on security issues.",
                    "Well, it is 2018 now and Jonathan is chilling in his big house at Otuoke enjoying all his loots and today the person in charge of our lives and property is non-other than President Muhammadu Buhari. Looking back in retrospect, thinking of the reasons why I like the majority of Nigerians supported the emergence of Buhari as President was because we strongly believed he was the “Mr. capable” who can guarantee our safety. Its been 3 years down the road and the way the Buhari administration has handled security issues is so disturbing to me especially as it seems to me now like the herdsmen, Cattle rustlers, kidnappers and Boko Haram are competing for the highest killers of Nigeria. This is happening right under the watch of a government who came into power with SECURITY OF LIVES AND PROPERTIES being one of its key campaign points.",
                    "To be 100%, and in the spirit of fairness though, many of the security situations ravaging Nigeria today, in particular, this herdsmen issue predates this administration, meaning this conflict has been going on for many years before Buhari became president. As far as I can remember, herdsmen clashing with their local host communities resulting in the loss of lives and properties has been going on for more than 10 years. But for a government that campaigned heavily on the security of Nigerians, you’d expect that they’ve had time to critically examine the situation, done their homework and have a blueprint or a strategic plan which they intend to execute in order to completely die down the killings but that didn’t happen. What happened? More killings every day. Hardly do you go through the news without a news of herdsmen, kidnappers, cattle rustlers and terrorist involving many lost lives and properties. I was preparing my points for this video when I read the news of the attack in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau states. The images and videos from this attack available online are horrific and heart wrenching. The number of casualties is unknown due to a conspiracy by the army to downplay the death toll figure, but publicly available information put the number to between 86 to150 dead.",
                    "I personally find it very unreasonable and can’t seem to wrap my head around why this government is failing to secure our lives and properties, why? because the President, Mohammadu Buhari, the Commander in Chief is a retired General of the Nigerian Army. He had ruled Nigeria so this job is not new. This man is also a beneficiary of international military training during his days in service. He is an experienced war veteran who has also lead peacekeeping missions outside Nigeria. Therefore, there is absolutely no excuse or reason why the situation of the country should be out of his control. Again why? Because he has every tool and authority at his disposal to be one step ahead of these killer herdsmen and terrorist in Nigeria so why should the situation get this bad?",
                    "Why is President Muhammadu Buhari, with all his military training, experiences, skills that he has acquired throughout his military and civilian life not been able to put a decisive end to this very issue? The other day the Presidential spokesman blamed Buhari’s political opponents for the killings which is bullshit if you ask me because when Jonathan blamed his political opponents for Boko Haram, Chibok and all that APC/Buhari were quick to call him an “ogogoro drinker” but then if they claim that the killings are POLITICAL, then what about the SOLUTION? Political too? What is the excuse?",
                    "In the early days of this administration, the President made some bad judgments which added to the then growing economic situation of the country left behind by Jonathan. This mistakes led our economy into recession which cost Buhari the hope and goodwill that Nigerians gave him at the election. Taking this long to address the growing insecurity in the country is another mistake being made and unless something is done today, with the speed of light, it will definitely cost Buhari in 2019, in a free and fair election.",
                    "These past years, due to Boko Haram and the crazy state of the security of the country, the government has increased the defense budget like never done before and even took billions of Naira in loans on the need of addressing the country’s insecurity, meaning more money ending up in some people’s pocket. So I ask, what is the reason for the incompetence of this administration that made it impossible to find a lasting remedy to the everyday massacre of poor Nigerians by herdsmen, could the reason be POLITICAL too just like they claim the killings are?",
                    "– Keyboard reaction by BJ-Mighty",
                    "It took Goodluck almost his entire presidency to figure this thing out. The truth is that the Nigerian security forces are completely useless, how can you expect them to risk their lives for the very same people they have no problem killing themselves. When Goodluck delayed the elections by 6 weeks, he secretly paid South African mercenaries to come to Nigeria to fight Boko Haram and it was them that kicked Boko all the way back to Sambisa forest. They were getting ready to finish them when Buhari became President and cancelled the contract.",
                    "When they organised an offensive to retake Sambisa and as usual the Nigerian soldiers choose to run away instead of attacking, they adopted the current policy of containment. They will surround them , cut them of from food and bomb them from the air in the hope that they will surrender. This has been the strategy for the last 3 years.",
                    "With regards to the Herdsmen, we in the North (apart from people in Jos) learnt a long time ago that you don't mess with the fulani herdsmen. They are not Nigerians, they travel all over west Africa with their cows and they have managed to survive this long by been ruthless. Kill one of them or worse a cow and you can be 100% sure they will retaliate.",
                    "Because of Boko haram and the devastation of the North East, the route they take has changed slightly to take them more south resulting in the current state of affairs. All the people taking on the herdsmen need to realise that they have more to loose than them and the Nigerian security forces are not going to defend or protect them",
                    "It could go both ways, it can be political someone might be politically behind these herdsmen and it might not be because we have always have tribal issues. Nigeria is a lawless country so anything could be political but I personally think Nigerian government needs a thorough cleansing under a military rule for 5 years. Sounds horrible? I know, Buhari wanted to do so many things to kick start his government but the senate and their vote keep blocking it; which made it difficult for Buhari to rule the way he had planned.  At the moment democratic is not the answer, it means the abysmal state in which Nigeria is now, first need to be cleanse under a no nonsense government that have the interest of the masses at heart."

First it was appointments, then conclusion of pending corruption cases, and now MKO - even going as far as declaring him winner. It just seems too convenient and a far cry from our collective experience since his inauguration.",

Not because I can't (I am sure he has them), but because it is evidence he at least wants to do the right thing. It shows he is not willing to make this just about himself, or his tribe. It shows he actually listens to be people outside his circle of sycophants.",

This isn't something we should single out Abiola for.He might be a bit sketchy but still miles ahead of any leader we've had since then. I still believe we could have come a long way if he had been sworn in.",
                    "This is mostly my opinion about him, but whenever I consider Fela's views on the man, I really wonder what shady things MKO has also done",

                    "He considered him a corrupt businessman with selfish goals, infact he called MKO out in his song 'ITT'(International Thief Thief) which was ironically the name of the company headed by MKO back then. I'll check for a link of the song and post",
                    "Criminal is a strong word. It's like saying Dangote is a mafia boss.",

                    "Abiola was believed to have been a fraudster at some point. \"Dangote is a mafia boss\" doesn't exactly fit here.",
                    "Alright, for the sake of full disclosure, here is what i know. Abiola was a very intelligent and prolific accountant. Studied somewhere in Europe, I can't remember where exactly. He worked as an accountant for a while, made some money, and then ventured into the publishing business. He got lucky, made more money and then diversified. Eventually, he got so rich that he began to do business directly with the federal government on behalf of Nigerians. I can't remember exact details of what he did, but he seems he may have knowingly participated in business practices with the Shagari government which contributed to the direct or indirect impoverishment of many Nigerians. Fela definitely didn't like him. He thought he was a snake oil guy with a false sense of geniality. But Fela never really like a praised a lot of people. This is just about as far as anyone will be willing to go to cast a negative light on Abiola.",
                    "But with that said. Whatever Abiola may or may not have done, he was known to be a very generous, empathetic and charismatic man. People LOVED him wherever he went. He was known to dole out huge bails of cash to people like candy. Some people say he was too generous. Abiola didn't care who you were, he was always such a positive guy, with a genuinely good heart. It is widely believed that if he had been president, he would have done a lot of great things for the masses. Will he have enriched himself? Probably, but he was not a selfish guy, so you can be sure he was not going to punish Nigerians.",
                    "When you use a word like \"Criminal\" to characterize Abiola, it seems a little harsh, at least in my opinion. He may have participated in less than ideal businesses, but he was never known to have done anything categorically criminal.",
                    "I mention Dangote because he is also known for his predatory business practices. He treats his workers harshly and cares only about his bottom line. Some would say that his closeness to political power has granted him access to contracts and business favors without having to compete like everyone else for them. Are we than to say he is a bad guy?",

                    "But these advances in behaviour can be chalked up to common good sense, not necessarily to any particular religion's influences, imagine if Mary Slessor came and abolished the killing of twins alright but then genuinely thought that albinos were the cohorts of Satan and should be burned? What would the gullible natives have done then? Religion just like fossil fuels and \"Days of our lives\" had some positive effects once but are now anachronistic and must be phased out.",

You might sacrifice a goat or chicken but thats no different than muslims during Eid and Elaya or with Christians during their holidays. I dont know anyone that was initited that had to get any markings. That does not mean it does not happen but I think you might be misjudging your heritage.",

If you mean an understanding of the scientific method and tools for recording and making observations then no, at least not at a comparable level with our European contemporaries. But if you mean an appreciation for nature and observing its laws then yes.",
                    "No because most of us are religious fanatics",
                    "Only some of the northern Nigerian Muslims are fanatics. It's highly unlikely to find traditional, christian or even muslim radicalists (like the Edo and Yoruba muslims) in other parts of the country.",
                    "It's really just the point in history we are right now. While the Crusades were happening it was Christians who were the bloodthirsty killers. All religions are equally susceptible to being co-opted by terrorists. The mix of social, economic, political and geographic factors just led to the religion of suicidal fanatics being Islam, at this point in history.",
                    "the crusades, at least initially, were a response to 400 years of Muslim aggression. why was there no crusade for 1000 years and only after Muslims kept invading and invading since literally the inception of Islam? Islam started with conquest and continues.",
                    "I uses the crusades as an anecdote. Whether Christians or Muslims caused it is debatable and in any case that wasn't even my point. My point is that every religion has contemptible actors and majority of these evil people happen to be Muslims at this point in history for a whole host of reasons. All religions can be used for evil and must be done away with.",
                    "there's a big difference for one religion having being in existence for 1000 years, like many times the length of existence of the USA for example and having no conquest or large scale war, versus a religion whose founder engaged in warfare until his very death, conquering and driving out all other religions in his home area and his successors one after the other continuing this rapidly conquering and expanding. the example of the religions \"perfect man\" makes a big difference. and due to certain reasons, people make the people who fight back look like the bad guys and the aggressors as innocent.",
                    "how many majority Muslim countries are now Christian to this day? turkey was once the center of the Christian world with the largest church in the world and to this day it's a Muslim country with the church made into a mosque. how many extremely famous and large mosques were made into churches and remain so to this day? Egypt used to be a massive hub of Christianity and now almost all the Christians have been expelled.",
                    "I know from the outside looking in it seems like everything is more or less the same, and it's definitely more convenient or palatable to view it as such, but in my opinion objectively looking there does seem to be a big difference.",
                    "socioeconomic or oppression does not explain everything. Christians in the Middle East are by far some of the most oppressed people in the world. regularly denied opportunities, harassment with little recourse from the law, girls regularly kidnapped and forced conversion to this day, with the law preventing them from converting back etc. but how many suicide terrorist Christian groups are there in the Middle East? why is it so rare or basically just does not exist? there are Islamic militant groups in India despite them being a large percentage and Christians being a minority in India and also oppressed, militant groups in Bangladesh despite being the majority, groups in Indonesia despite them being the majority. why aren't there militant Christian groups in Indonesia despite being a discriminated minority?",
                    "I see you don't like The Holy Prophet very much.",
                    "Details details, all this one is story. This is not a \"my religion is more peaceful than yours\" contest. Whether the agents of any particular religion are more war-mongering or dangerous than another religion is debatable (people WILL DEBATE you) and besides my point. The world would be a better place if nobody followed any religion at all period, good god or bad god is immaterial. Nigeria would certainly be a better place.",
                    "well that is your opinion but it's not a fact and you don't really have any evidence for that as of yet. could be true but it remains to be seen. and just because people will debate you on something doesn't mean it's ambiguous or not true. people can and will debate you about flat earth, vaccines and loads of other topics. people can and will debate you about whether races are equal or not. you say that if everyone was an atheist that the world would be better but don't think there is any evidence or proof of that. the only large scale atheism we've seen so far were in communist countries and I'm not sure you can call that being better for them.",
                    "u/meowcarter I'm really enjoying discourse with you. You are certainly correct that the mere fact that people will debate you on a topic does not make it true/false. 100 percent correct. However look at the things that you brought up that people will debate you on.",
                    "flat earth, vaccines and loads of other topics. people can and will debate you about whether races are equal or not.",
                    "All these things (unlike whether Christianity is more \"peaceful\" than Islam) are rooted in scientific fact. These are objective truths, true whether there are people willing to debate them or not. Chritianity as a whole being more peaceful than Islam is an entirely subjective thing,  depending on who you are and where you come from. My stance that the world would be a better place without religion IS a hypothesis, but it's an informed one, hinged on the terrible effects of religion that I have observed in Nigeria and really the whole world.",
                    "the only large scale atheism we've seen so far were in communist countries and I'm not sure you can call that being better for them.",
                    "Oh please, I've heard that argument before, it's old. I could tell you a long story but I'll keep it short. Those places were atheist states in the sense that there was no magical god in charge of every person, they instead replace sky God with the god of the state, the god of dictatorship, the god of totalitarianism, the god of the personality. Those horrific leaders just took out the magic part and replaced god with themselves and used that power to control people. Same like religion. AND the many times I've read that these regimes were inspired by religion are too many to be a coincidence.",
                    "I'll respectfully disagree on the point that whether a religion inspires or even mandates violence and conquest is a subjective thing, I rather feel it is objective. We can agree to disagree on that point. When you say that communism removed belief in a supernatural god to the God of the state, I could agree with you - however I could almost propose as well based on that logic that it is part of human nature to \"worship\" something, whether it be the state/government, celebrities, wealth or something else.",
                    "Even if you don't agree with that, my question would be then, what evidence do we have then of a truly atheistic state or country and how do we know that things would be better off? considering that if you don't want to count communism as an atheistic state, has there ever been one? How do we know this would be better? If you also feel that while people can claim to be atheistic, they can morph into worshipping something else, the state in the example of communism, how can we even ensure or suppose that a group of people would ever remain atheistic and not fall into worshipping someone else? I would say that we've seen some form of worship of scientists like Sam Harris or Jordan Peterson etc, people tend to form cults of personalities around people and form tribes around it. In fact I've seen this a lot even with the fanbases of music artists.",
                    "Just some questions, would be interesting to hear your thoughts on it!",
                    "The arrival of the missionaries helped to stop a lot of barbaric acts. Further decrees handed down during the colonial era also contributed to reducing killings of a ritual nature. Islam had a role to play too, but the with radical islamic terrorism rearing its ugly head these days, the merits are being brought to question and rightly so.",
                    "With that said, the commercialisation of religion (especially christianity) has held back millions of lives.",
                    "Charismatic charlatans like Adeboye, Oyedepo, Apostle Suleman etc have succeeded in preying on the ignorance and greed of the people by twisting the scriptures and feeding them lies about the true values of Christianity. These so-called men of God fill their sermons with lies, meaningless personal anecdotes and excerpts from the Bible that completely ignores context. And the people, being poor and uneducated, being governed by a culture of subservience to authority and greed, are all too willing to accept these lies.",
                    "These pastors and bishops or whatever they call themselves only preach about prosperity and blessings. They tell these people to \"sow seeds\" and in doing that, that God will reward them with wealth and earthly pleasures, and they foolishly oblige. Both rich and poor.Their followers do not take time to study the scriptures themselves either because they do not want to see the light or are comfortable with being misled. Instead, they buy \"inspirational books and bible guides\" authored by these liars. They begin to ingest their lies. They begin to venerate them. This is obvious when you see their followers essentially begin to worship them at a certain point. Calling them \"Baba this\" and \"Daddy that\". Never questioning what these men say and ultimately becoming their sheep. Then it becomes all too clear that they aren't practising Christianity, but \"Redeemism\", \"Oyedepoism\", \"Dunamism\" or a variant of whatever church/minister whose twisted doctrines they follow.",
                    "Giving just one example, it is very easy to see that these ministers are actually fraudtsers.You see politicians who steal and government officials who destroy Nigeria and the life of Nigerians taking up the front seats of most churches today.Men who should be rebuked for their evil and shown that they are wrong are instead praised and giving positions of honor in the house of God. Why?Why? Why segregate the church? Why divide the church along social and financial lines? Why glorify evil? I'll tell you why. It is because they don't stand for anything.They are empty, arrogant, shallow men with neither morals nor values.They are only in it to steal from the poor and pander to the rich. It's all about money for them.They are not holy men or pastors or men of God. They are liars, they are conmen and they are the Pharisees of today.But then again, if you try to explain this to their followers, they will call you a blasphemer and continue to foolishy hold their Daddies and Babas in high regard.",
                    "I sincerely hope that Nigerians come to their senses and see that the Oyedepos, Adeboyes, Suleimans, Oyakhilomes etc of today are nothing but deceivers, manipulators and antichrists who are out to enrich themsleves.",
                    "I wish to see the day they become free from their bondage and come to the realisation that after our rotten government and institutions, The Church and the False Gospel of Prosperity it currently practices are the next biggest destroyers of Nigeria and Nigerians.",
                    "Thanks u/Dearest_Caroline I only wish the brainwashed masses could understand this.",
                    "It is very easy to see religion and blame it. But ask your self, would everything still happen without religion? Would these scam pastors not go to another scam? Would these terrorist groups not still agree with election results?",
                    "Everything would be the exact same way if you remove religion. People are EVIL, religion is just a tool they use, if you remove it, they will get another tool",
                    "Very much agree with this. If it wasn't religion it would be fascism, communism or some other ism",
                    "Would these scam pastors not go to another scam?",
                    "Besides high-level corporate fraud, there is hardly anything that comes close to what these pastors do. If these pastors were instead involved in Yahoo Yahoo or Pyramid schemes for example, they would be nowhere near as rich and wouldnt corrupt as many people.",
                    "IMHO religion has become a divisive factor in our society. It is a tool of oppression and exploitation. In the South religion is used to fleece the gullible searching for miracles while in the North it is used to deny vulnerable groups opportunities to succeed in the 21st century. It's bad enough that we do the whole \"son of the soil\" thing but religion takes it to a whole new level.",
                    "Religion has also fostered mediocrity in our political space. It's common to hear that executive positions are shared based on ethnicity and religion with merit relegated to the background.",
                    "It's interesting to note that whole the rest of the civilized world is moving away from myths and superstition Africa is still a hotbed of illogical religious reasoning. That's the reason why we are not developing as a continent.",
                    "People say Nigeria is where it is today because of it Pastors and spiritual men... But I believe Nigeria is where it is today because of our love and compassion for others.",
                    "Religion has done more good than harm to our society.i know some religion have extremist that are inconsiderate in their actions and perpetuate barbaric act. Religion help us to get past some of our dark and traditional ways and in a way make it easier for us to accept civilization",
                    "You were already civilized before christianity. Or how do you explain how the European used the BIBLE to prove you as less than????",

                    "One of the very few advantages of being locked indoors as a kid was that, the energy that would have been spent running around the yard was expended instead on old newspapers and magazines from the 80s. The result being a natural proclivity to write lengthy meaningless essays while trying to exhaust registers of different fields.",
                    "Most of us cannot go to the toilet without a book. I'd installed an Oxford dictionary in ours, each poo session lasting roughly 1hr15min. There was no WhatsApp, Facebook nor Twitter.",
                    "Spare time not spent in the loo was spent reading Novels or playing video games during the few hours \"NEPA would bring light \" for.  I was not a fan of popular authors, I enjoyed Errol Flynn's \" My Wicked Wicked ways\", Macbeth, Pride and Prejudice, Canterbury tales, the great Gatsby, how to kill a Mockingbird, 1984 and books from the Pacesetter series...",
                    "These were my English tutors, I excelled privately and failed in the classroom. Human tutors made me sore. I only passed whenever my English teacher accorded me special attention, I wanted to be pampered, I wanted to be  revered...",
                    "WhatsApp notification cuts my reverie short.. Actually, that's the crux of my woes today. Considering the fact that most of our learning is involuntary and unconsciously, we constantly absorb toxic grammar from various platform. These are expressed as misspellings, mixed up tenses, confusing homonyms and cooked up phrasal verbs. Reading vernacular and pidgin English is pretty straightforward, but the dangerous part is wrong English packaged as correct English. If one is not careful, the brain absorbs these toxins and shelves them for use on a later date.",
                    "In the years immediately preceding the advent of full blown social media, there were concerns raised in some quarters, that impeccable written English had become a rare commodity particularly in the younger folk - that so many of us are unable to write error-free formal letters. SMS was charged, tried and found guilty of being responsible for the decline in our writing culture. But today, the situation is even worse, contractions and abbreviations are no longer the problem,  the proliferation of 'blog' posts written by dunces, actually writing for ad revenue, these same toxic posts sent to our phones and mail addresses as news feeds, making it impossible to prevent infection. You want news, the news post is infected. You want gist, the popular sites are infected - the posts and the comments!",
                    "Is there a way out? I don't think so",
                    "If you look at your dictionary, you will realize that over 20% of words aren't being used like they are intended, they have modern definitions along side their true definitions. If you read the original Shakespeare it would be unreadable unenjoyable and extremely irritating.",
                    "The people decide the language, not the other way round. That's why British, American and Singaporean English are recognized as different languages",
                    "I was going to make this exact comment. It should be people who create language, not the other way around. English is one language, there are others. English should not be given preferential treatment",
                    "I learnt Hausa informally, by absorption actually, and I realised Hausa is a very lazy language. Tenses are used sparingly. You only need to learn nouns, verbs and pronouns which are gender specific by the way. I am more open to studying Hausa formally.",
                    "It is not a secret that English language is second class in the north, pupils and students struggle to survive because of the language barrier when the language of instruction is English. Even in cases where the teacher has a working knowledge of Hausa, a lot still gets lost in translation. There is always a deficiency, either in his knowledge of English or Hausa.  And this is a language that is widely spoken in Northern Nigeria, even beyond our borders. A way out would have been translation of textbooks into Hausa, and   passing legislature to allow examinations to be set with Hausa as instruction language.",
                    "Why do we go to school? To gain knowledge. If that knowledge is not gained due to language barrier, then what good have we done? Then why waste their time in schools? Politically, it would be seen as a wrong move, people would claim certain tribes are being given preferential treatment, and it is contradictory to an earlier post of mine where I claim the concept of \"3 major ethnic groups\" is being forced down our throats. But we have limited options. We claim Nigeria has immense human resources, but these resources become liabilities when significant proportion are uneducated and undereducated. The present scenario is even worse - someone who claims to be a graduate, flaunts a certificate and has equal opportunities with you who toiled for yours. He cannot speak English, fine. He cannot explain the subject matter in Hausa, because he was taught in English which he doesn't understand. And he gets the job ahead of you because of quota system and he's from an educational less developed area. How can an area be educationally less developed for decades? In spite of easy admissions, scholarships etc This is not the time for political correctness, this is the time to strategically position Nigeria.",
                    "I see where you are coming from. Honestly... I do. In fact, I am willing to adjust my initial sentiment about the topic. In a country like Nigeria, there have to be required standards to reach when teaching the English language. Those standards have to be met, absolutely.",
                    "Nigeria is a soup pot of cultures and languages. It would be an absolute nightmare if we had to interact with each other without an intermediate language. If there is one thing I thank our colonizers for, it is that.",
                    "That said, I think the idea that we need to give special treatment to Hausa people because \"language barrier\" is silly. There is an already ready-made solution for that. It is called an education. We as a people need to move away from making excuses for ourselves. Think of how it may play out. Say Hausa people get to speak and learn only Hausa and write exams in Hausa, are the rest of us then supposed to learn Hausa as well? Because surely we have to interact. If our president is Hausa, we have to able to hear what he says. What if Ibibio people also say, \"you know what, fuck this! We want to write exams in Ibibio too\". Or Ijaw, or Junkun? Igbo? You see where I am going with this. It is really silly.",
                    "Hausa people are not intrinsically stupid. Even if they were (which they are not), they are not so stupid as to be unable to learn a new language. They do it every time. Many Hausas in the southwest are perfectly fluent in Yoruba despite not living there in their formative years. We know many of their leaders are perfectly fluent in English. From men like Tafawa Balewa, Ahmadu Bello, Lamido Sanusi.. who all speak near perfect queens English. To men like Shehu Sani and Nasir ElRufai who are evidently articulate and quite intelligent actually.",
                    "The problem is a failure of leadership on the part of the Northern leaders, and simply a lack of prioritization of education in Northern Nigeria in general. That needs to change, period. The FG has to take the bull by the horns and overhaul the educational system wholesale. Massive education campaigns have to be made a priority. Laws need to be made the heavily incentivize (read coerce) parents and guardians into sending their under 18 wards to school. NYSC corpers should be incentivized to teach in underserved areas. Teachers need to be retrained and paid much more than they are. If you raise salaries at the same time you raise standards, you will see an elevation in overall quality.",
                    "Finally, most importantly. Citizens should get involved. People need to cry out for better funding of the education sector. It needs to be a political issue. As per, if you don't have it on your agenda to raise the budget for education, you should not be president. If the people don't take the issue seriously, the FG does not really have a reason to, not in Nigeria at least.",
                    "True. Very true.",
                    "There are african languages that sever as intemediaries. Frankly speaking Nigerians have a terrible grasp of the English language. I grew up in america and my relatives have a terrible way of speaking english. It does not make sense half the time.",
                    "All hell would be let loose when Nigerian English is formally recognized. Because it would be a license to murder English. Misspellings and inexistent phrasal verbs are inexcusable.",
                    "I agree that people decide the language - but there are structures and rules, so the evolved language can be taught to others. But when every Hom, Tick and Darry twists  language instead of learning its proper use, then I think we have a big problem on our hands..",
                    "There are still rules. Most of them are just far more lax than you think",
                    "Pretty sure Nigerian English is already formally recognised in some contexts.",
                    "If I'm honest- Nigerians tend to suffer either from poor grammar or superfluous vocabulary.",
                    "In formal settings it seems a lot of Nigerians (me included) will vomit a dictionary.",
                    "Oh well, as long as communication is effective for its target audience- I have little concern.",
                    "True. But the disease is more chronic than you realize. We can still vomit dictionaries because of solid foundation we had. But what is the fate of the millennial generation?",
                    "Millennial generation is the 80s and 90s kids - those who currently form the bedrock of the workforce. And we know how bad the situation is there - pity the iGeneration who never knew a world without ubiquitous cellphones and the Internet.",

I wouldn't say true justice has been served 100% because we still haven't been given a good reason for why the results were annulled in the first place. IBB said it was because he heard rumors that MKO was going to be assassinated. This is the most Bullshit reason I have heard anyone give for anything. No one has gone to jail, or even stood trial. MKO did end up getting assassinated, but nothing happened there either.",

                    "I’m a graphic designer from Portugal. I wanted to design a series of posters for the upcoming World Cup, and while brainstorming around the idea of the ball I came up with the idea of having each poster showcase some kind of spheric or circular object that is traditional/specific to each country in the World Cup, something that is beautiful or tasty or meaningful or useful or historic or for some reason relevant to the country.",
                    "So, having said this, can you guys think of any objects, tools, foods, symbols, artworks, plants, animals or really anything at all past or present from or relating to Nigeria that might be a good center-piece for the Nigerian poster?",
                    "Everyone knows the top players from each country and I thought these posters could be a good way of people all around learning about a lesser known aspect of each culture, so please don’t be afraid of throwing in far-fetched, little known stuff, as long as they are somehow relevant to your local/national culture. They don’t even have to be real, it can be something, for example, out of a folk tale.",
                    "Thank you so much everyone for your time and your help!",
                    "PS: a version of this post will be posted across all the national subreddits of countries participating in the World Cup.",

                    "I always found the idea suspect, I mean there is no such thing (as far as I know) as Pan-Europeanism or Pan-Asianism or Pan-SouthAmericanism. It seems to appeal to the idea of Africa as just a very big country with interchangeable people and cultures and doesn't take into account that Africa is the most genetically and ethnically diverse continent. I definitely love they idea of Africans working together but I would love it to be because all Africans are humans not because we are (predominantly) negroes and share a victim narrative of colonialism. Maybe I misunderstand the point? I do support the African union though for economics and diplomacy reasons. But I would love to hear your thoughts.",
                    "I would counter your point about Pan-Europeanism by saying that the European Union is sort of a practical, grounded expression of that ideal.",
                    "In fact, the founding of the EU was based almost entirely on this idea given the devastating effect of the world wars in the region. That being said, while they enjoy things like Freedom of Movement of People and Goods and Services, they are still able to appreciate and protect their diverse cultures.",
                    "I believe the idea of Pan-Africanism is good at its heart. Yes, we are a very diverse set of people but we can be stronger together. We can make the lives of our people easier if the African Union emulated the heart of the EU at least with an emphasis on practical ways to spur development as well as safeguard or protect the diversity of our cultures and experiences.",
                    "From a more idealistic point of view however, I like the idea of Pan-Africanism. I like the idea of anything that makes us see and connect more with what unites us rather than what separates us. When it comes to the experience of trauma, which again was a major contributing factor to the formation of the EU, then almost all African countries have experienced a similar kind of trauma from the ills of colonisation or slave trade in its various forms and guises. We’re yet to heal from this pain. We can do it together, we can build ourselves up together, we can boost our collective self esteem by realising that we can rely more on our own strength to present a united front rather than continuing to think or believe that all our assistance needs to come from outside the continent or that whatever comes from off the continent is inherently better.",
                    "It seems like a pipe dream however because living in Nigeria it’s clear that so many people still find it hard to see past their tribe or their (foreign) religion to appreciate the humanity that we all share.",
                    "Lastly, even if Africa was one big country, we’d still be dragging population with India and China, two very diverse countries too, ethnically and culturally.",
                    "Lastly (for real), seeing ourselves as so separate or different from each other makes us easier to exploit. If we presented a unified front, it would be harder. We’d have a better idea of our collective worth and we would work harder to protect it.",
                    "So, I guess we mostly agree that there are benefits to the ideology.",
                    "Interesting points thank you. Clearly there are advantages to Pan-Africanism, do you see any disadvantages or ways that it is currently practiced or utilised can be improved? Any critiques?",
                    "I’m gonna have to do a loooot more reading first. So, watch this space.",
                    "Me too. This is a very interesting subject.",
                    "When you say Pan-Africanism, are you also including North Africa? This is because I think I read somewhere about the concept of Pan-Arabian/Arabism (cannot remember the word again) being propagated within that region. Also, to me, sometimes, I have this perception that North Africans are only Africans when it convenient or when the agenda favours them.",
                    "My point is that we are not so united in thinking and actions as a continent to achieve Pan Africanism. This is coming from my own naive perception, as I do not have a background in the social sciences.",
                    "I think so too, North African countries in my opinion seem more like Arabia annex and don't fit into the Pan-african union as much when it comes to history of colonisation/slavery complex. They do at times seem like fairweather Africans.",
                    "I like the idea of us being more connected and helping each other, but we shouldn’t replace our amazing and unique diversity with a vision of “one Africa”.",
                    "Hi, I stumbled here while exploring subreddits and I thought I'd give my opinion as an outsider. I hope it's not unwelcome.",
                    "In my opinion, DigitalDibia put it very well. From an idealistic and futuristic perspective, a Pan Africa can be be beneficial for Africas economic and social growth and development. However, before a pan Africanism can be achieved, all African members of such a union have to achieve similar levels of growth and stability. While not all EU members are equally well off, they're within the same range of social, economic, political and welfare development. That is the reason eastern europe is not a part of the EU, it doesn't fit these categories.",
                    "Africas countries are too diverse in socio economic, political and human development as of 2018. Some countries like Nigeria are far ahead in terms of gdp, others like Kenya are rapidly growing, others like Rawanda have high levels of socio economic development, while some are lagging in all metrics. Until there are at least 10 countries within a similar range, a pan africa movement doesn't make much sense. Then too, it would start with these 10 then evolve to include more. For now something like the AU is sufficient.",
                    "I believe that this is the same reason there is no Pan Latin America, Pan North America, Pan Asia movements despite some of those sharing the same language, culture etc. The countries are disparate economically and in human development. There was an attempt at Pan Arabism which failed miserably because the arab countries are too different, especially economically when you compare a poor egypt with a rich UAE, with only a shared language. Even their religion is practiced differently. The GCC meanwhile succeeded because the gulf countries are very similar.",

France and the US would have benefited the most since England had gotten most of the middle East after their scam in world war 2 where they tricked the Arab tribes into destroying the ottaman empire then sized all the profitable land in the area starting conflicts we still feel today.

The war started with a diversion plan, the Nigerian Army attacked the oil well to take it back. Biafra attacked the Midwest and slaughtered their families. The Nigerian Army rode in on Soviet tanks and British planes, but you must be mentally reduced not to realize that Biafra rode in on French tanks and American planes.",

If you told me this in person I wouldn't be so irritated, I would say you can't read. But you can use the internet and yet you choose stupidity? You can read and yet you don't see that over a million of our country people died to fill the tanks of cars they would never drive? You are so attached the your stupid notion of the victim that you don't see the corruption of the People you follow? I am ashamed that Nigerians like you exist in the 21st century",

He had only asked that the genocide stop and everyone come to the table to settle differences.

                    "Next is the military. Have I mentioned that officers above the equivalent of Colonel in all branches would be retired?",
                    "A significant part of our budget would go into war preparedness and personnel development. It is absurd that noncombatants sit in the office idly all day carrying out mundane administrative tasks, while combatants are reduced to policemen and escorts.",
                    "The first step is to improve the quality of intakes. The National Youth Service Corps would be streamlined into the military and  restructured into an 18 months programme - the first 9 months would be compulsory military service and the 2nd 9 months, the corp member chooses either to teach, farms, work in an industry, go into entrepreneurship or go to the private sector etc. He/She does this while living in the barracks throughout the service period, and the supervisor would be a military officer.  On completing the programme, corp members may apply for commissioning or go back to civilian life as reservists. Civilians below the age of 40 who wish to have basic military training would go through the citizenship and leadership training centre, acquiring training, civic education, practical discipline and classes on sustainable development.",
                    "Transforming the military into a mini economy may have some beneficial effect. Instead of sitting idly, soldiers and officers would be encouraged to learn handiwork (leatherwork, maintenance, ICT, physical education etc), and the barracks open to patrons from the civilian population. The increased revenue would not be the only advantage, but better military-civilian relations too. The same template would be applied to Prisons service, with prisoners encouraged to go into handiwork, pursue additional academic qualification. Libraries would be built in every prison nationwide, stocked with books, open to prisoners, to provide intellectual stimulation. With proper implementation, it is possible to have prison workshops providing services to the general public. Emphasis should be placed on developing inmates while they are incarcerated, so that they do not have adaptation problems and become a burden on release.",
                    "Isn't it surprising that while Nigerian soldiers live in makeshift quarters and are overcrowded in barracks, authorities still sell barracks land to members of the public and high ranking officials. Considering that officers below the rank of colonel would most likely not have benefitted from the irregular sales, it would not be difficult to reacquire these lands and build housing quarters for military personnel.",
                    "The police and the paramilitary branches would experience similar transformation. The NSCDC particularly would have an increased role - from protecting facilities such as Farm processing and storage sites, power infrastructure, government buildings, railway infrastructure and other assets prone to vandalism. Vandalism is a form of economic sabotage, and the penalty for sabotage is death or Life imprisonment. The officer directly involved in protecting the vandalized or sabotaged asset would lose his job and face arraignment, the same fate awaits his boss. This would promote effective service delivery.",
                    "All the essential ingredients are available, bountiful and in position... what do we need to pull them all together? Government policy.",
                    "This government knows nothing about policy. This government does not know the role of government in governance. This government does not know its job. I watched the campaign strategist for the APC, Festus Keyamo claim on channels TV, that a democratic  government does not need ministers to function. That the ministries run on bureaucratic process. So, who sets the policy mandate and direction of the ministries? He proposes ministries are run based on an \"anywhere belle face \" process.",
                    "Festus Keyamo is now on the payroll of the FG. He will now be useless to the populace. Remember Femi Fani Kayode? Yeah, Festus Keyamo is on his way to becoming the new FFK.",
                    "It is scary to imagine what could have transformed him. The promise of power? Money? Or is it diabolical? Though I've never been a fan of civil rights activists",
                    "It's simple, all of the above. Keyamo has been hired as campaign DG or something. He has officially being bought. Anything he says that paints the government in a less than positive light will be against his own interests, even it means he has to lie to the public. So he will lie. He will be disingenuous and dishonest because he feels he has no other choice.",
                    "The right thing to do will be to take his public voice. Stop bringing him on TV so much unless it has to do with something only he will be best positioned to address. And even then, you have to be extra careful. The problem with Keyamo, not unlike Kayode, is that he is very manipulative. He is a lawyer after all, and a good one at that. He will say just about anything to make himself sound right, and give that impression, even when he knows he is wrong.",
                    "Then how does he sleep at night? He is sacrificing his integrity and career on the altar of a moribund administration?",
                    "He has convinced himself he is doing this for the greater good. To be fair, he has a point. up to this point, the FG has done poor job with public relations and making the government look good. They need someone like Keyamo right now. Otherwise, the opposition might hijack the narrative and weaponize it against them come 2019.",
                    "Next is the working class. Industrial and white collar workers. Public-private partnerships would be encouraged. Areas under the private sector that are prone to monopoly and exploitative producer behavior would be nationalized and partnerships established. The role of government is not to run enterprises, but to oversee and provide technological seed capital and in rare cases financial aid.",
                    "Financing would be geared mostly towards the development and acquisition of technological solutions. These technology would then be injected into the various sectors of the economy under the supervision of the relevant ministries.",
                    "As for the actual running of the economy, these would be left in the hands of renowned experts eg Bismarck Rewane etc My knowledge on economics is limited, so I cannot make any proposals on policy.",
                    "With politicians, their aides and special assistants now inexistent, there should be enough funds to establish continuous professional development for workers. Working hours would be reorganized into morning and evening and night shifts. Run from 8am to 2pm, morning shifts would apply to administrative workers, afternoon shifts and night shifts for Industrial workers and those whose jobs demand working round the clock. 8am to 2pm shifts would give most people the time to pursue other ventures, agriculture especially. Remuneration would be based on work done and hours worked.",
                    "The last focus would be on the professionals. Engineers, Nurses, Lecturers, School teachers, Lawyers etc",
                    "Continuous development and opportunity provided for their input on policymaking.",
                    "The concept of democracy is brilliant, designed to give the average person a voice, inclusive governance, numerous checks and balances and decision making a matter of majority. But what happens when majority are illiterate, uninformed and  apathetic ? What happens when the checks deliberately introduce flaws?",
                    "The legislature is supposed to curtail the executive but the executive have thrown out the rule of law. The legislature use their veto power to protect their interests such as altering budgets and election sequence.  Democracy makes a provision for impeachment of executive, and a provision for recall of the legislature, regionalism and nepotism have made the former impossible and ignorance has made the latter impossible.",
                    "The judiciary has seem judgements and orders repeatedly ignored by both executive and legislature. Orders are only carried out in petty criminal cases involving common folk.",
                    "We've seen a case of a police chief summoned and refuses to appear, claiming only the President can order him around. And the President claims he didn't know that the IGP didn't go to Benue when ordered to in the wake of killings by herdsmen. So who controls the IGP?",
                    "Considering the foregoing and so many other violations, I feel that there is an awareness and social literacy threshold that must be surpassed in at least 50% of general population before democracy can be beneficial to any society.  For now, Nigeria needs an autocratic, benevolent dictatorship - a council of 36 military officers from the 36 states, men of impeccable character, not higher than the rank of Colonel.

They destroy the government, but they stop short of taking power and implementing the second phase of their plans. Instead, the saddle an ill-prepared military Gen, who had no knowledge of their plans up to this point, with the task of leading a bleeding nation with many understandably angry parties? Come on, man. Let's not kid ourselves.",

The return of Ibo people to their home region. The civil war? The transfer of power from one military dictatorship to the next, always by coup, and each one worse than the one it replaced?. Many bloody? How do you explain that?",

The coup plotters had no intention to give Ironsi power, Ironsi had been marked for death. Until IBB, every both democraties were far worse than the military. Gowon's regime was wasteful, the military equivalent of Jonathan's, Murtala Muh'd's was reformatory, the problem was that his hands were soiled with blood from the previous coup and the war. Shagari's democracy was the typically Nigerian democracy, corrupt and nepotistic. After Idiagbon, IBB took us back to the dark ages. Let's not forget that there was a call for social revolution, Gideon Orkar, he was not heeded, ended up being executed. We cannot justify all the bloodshed, neither can we fold our hands and watch it continue in 2018.",
                    "That's the biggest problem. Transforming our ethnic diversity into strength. First of all, we must destroy the theory of 3 major ethnic groups. It is wrong, insulting and divisive. Our ethnic group should be 'Nigerian' while we'd retain diverse cultures and traditions based on ancestry and place of birth. Another instance of semantics causing problems, is in the titles of traditional rulers. For example, the Lamido of Adamawa is the Paramount ruler of the Fulani and fombina emirate, the Fulani are predominantly in Yola and surrounding areas. Adamawa on the other hand is a very large and diverse state made up of over 100 ethnic groups. Thus, when a stranger hears \"Lamido of Adamawa\", the impression is that this is the king over the whole state. And this is not true. The same applies to Warri and the Olu of Warri.",
                    "The reason the first coup failed, was because majority of the planners and executors were from a particular ethnic group, and in Lagos, the plotters failed to neutralize the top military officer, their kinsman, who would later seize power. This was the same reason that after the Counter coup and his death, leadership was passed to someone from an \" ethnic minority \". The ethnic stuff has always been there. Until we remove things such as state of origin, tribe etc a revolution would almost be unachievable",

Crude, our life blood, comes from the minority Niger Delta. The Hausa who are among the majority 3, are not found all over Nigeria. Their areas of origin is roughly equivalent to the land mass of most minority groups. Journeying in northern Nigeria, made me understand that the north is as diverse as the south, but it is deliberately made to look homogeneous for political reasons. Hausa language being actively imposed as formal dialect in every area above the Confluence. Today, the language self propagates, the end result is that smaller ethnic groups in the North have been assimilated, some have disappeared, and others are struggling to survive as native speakers of their dialects die off.",

Just the way Arabic was forced on many ethnicities during the early days of Islam in the Middle East (notably in what is now present-day Iran) because it was \"the language of Islam\", the same thing is happening with Hausa and the other ethnicities in the north.  Their language, culture and identity are all being washed away by Hausa influence and the culture of Islam.If you are a northerner and you don't speak Hausa, your chances of securing a notable position in the political scene are almost zero.",

I do not advocate for blogger registrations, but at least there should be sanity in reporting. Opinion pieces such as these are harmless, but when uninformed opinion are presented as news then there is a problem.  The problem between dictatorships and the press often stems from the tendency of the latter to be influenced by hostile foreign powers. In this case, the displaced politicians are not going to sit and watch, they would be organized into a vibrant fifth column, claiming rights violations and  calling for free, fair elections.

Gowon's regime was wasteful, the military equivalent of Jonathan's, Murtala Muh'd's was reformatory, the problem was that his hands were soiled with blood from the previous coup and the war. Shagari's democracy was the typically Nigerian democracy, corrupt and nepotistic. After Idiagbon, IBB took us back to the dark ages. Let's not forget that there was a call for social revolution, Gideon Orkar, he was not heeded, ended up being executed.

It is wrong, insulting and divisive. Our ethnic group should be 'Nigerian' while we'd retain diverse cultures and traditions based on ancestry and place of birth. Another instance of semantics causing problems, is in the titles of traditional rulers. For example, the Lamido of Adamawa is the Paramount ruler of the Fulani and fombina emirate, the Fulani are predominantly in Yola and surrounding areas. Adamawa on the other hand is a very large and diverse state made up of over 100 ethnic groups. Thus, when a stranger hears \"Lamido of Adamawa\", the impression is that this is the king over the whole state. And this is not true. The same applies to Warri and the Olu of Warri.",

Crude, our life blood, comes from the minority Niger Delta. The Hausa who are among the majority 3, are not found all over Nigeria. Their areas of origin is roughly equivalent to the land mass of most minority groups. Journeying in northern Nigeria, made me understand that the north is as diverse as the south, but it is deliberately made to look homogeneous for political reasons. Hausa language being actively imposed as formal dialect in every area above the Confluence. Today, the language self propagates, the end result is that smaller ethnic groups in the North have been assimilated, some have disappeared, and others are struggling to survive as native speakers of their dialects die off.",

But Nigeria has its own peculiarities, the issue of ethnicity for instance - fake news capable of igniting ethnic unrest deserves sanctions. I do not advocate for blogger registrations, but at least there should be sanity in reporting. Opinion pieces such as these are harmless, but when uninformed opinion are presented as news then there is a problem.  The problem between dictatorships and the press often stems from the tendency of the latter to be influenced by hostile foreign powers. In this case, the displaced politicians are not going to sit and watch, they would be organized into a vibrant fifth column, claiming rights violations and  calling for free, fair elections. Social media could be their light ammo",

Fertility is the state of one's ability to procreate or have offspring. While it may have something to do with external genitals, it has much more to do with other internal factors like sperm count, ova count, age of female, previous STDs, congenital anomalies in the uterus and spermatic cord, fusion and scarring of the fallopian tubes. Each of the potential problems I mentioned are very hard to \"test\" with a simple single visit to the doctor's office. They are expensive and ellaborate, and are typically only done for patients with problems having kids.",

                    "The African bush baby is a figure of myth very popular in many ethnic folklores in Nigeria. There are different versions of the bush baby and different interpretations of its character traits and stories in its mythos.",
                    "In Yoruba oral tradition, the bush baby is described as a humanoid jungle creature, with a short stature, a bald head, big round eyes, and white chalk marking all over its body. They typically move in pairs and can be found only at night, never by themselves. They can often be recognized through the loud infantile shrieks that can be heard from great distances in the thick blackness of the forest- hence the name bush baby",
                    "Here is the interesting part.",
                    "A bush baby always carries two items- a woven reed mat rolled up and tucked away in one armpit, tightly. In the other hand, a short stick. According to myth, if a person is able to acquire the mat, and sleeps on it for the duration of one night, that person will be blessed with great fortune and immeasurable wealth for the rest of their life. If however, you get hit with the stick, you fall sick with an incurable sickness and die in only a few days.",
                    "In the many stories I have heard, people take great risk to acquire the mat. Usually by distracting one bush baby, and then wrestling the other for its mat without getting hit with a stick.",
                    "Really interesting stuff.",
                    "I'd love to hear other versions of the lore. Or any other tales-by-moonlight type stories.",
                    "Fascinating, I never heard this folklore and I never thought the Bush baby was a legendary creature, they're just cute."

                    "It's really interesting when I come across people who think like this. Why do people think Nigeria's \"Tribalism\" is different from other countries (especially young countries)  with diverse ethnic groups.",
                    "okwu.co",
                    "Because it is a major cause of most of our problems.",
                    "People think in terms of tribal and family units in Nigeria, and Africa in general. Tribalism breeds mistrust, selfishness, and greed. People don't want to see eye to eye on issues that are of mutual benefit to everyone involved.",
                    "When Nigeria was created, it was done for purely business reasons. The northern protectorate was broke and considered to be economically unfruitful. The southern protectorate, on the other hand, was very profitable and very well in the black as accountants like to say. So the British did what many big name corporate businesses do, they merged the two into one entity to  give the appearance of complete viability.",
                    "If you ask me, Nigeria was never supposed to be one country, and even the British knew it. One only needs to look at historical documents from the time period to find evidence of this. What is now Northern Nigeria really should be part of Niger, parts of Cameroon, and Chad. What is now southwestern Nigeria should also include large chunks of Benin and Togo. and what is now Southeastern Nigeria should also include parts of Southwestern Cameroon, including the Bakassi region. In other words, if we weren't colonized and carve up recklessly solely for the purpose of making accounting books look good, the region that is now Nigeria would probably be 3 countries who have a more homogenous mix of citizens and will be more likely to think as one.",
                    "But sadly, this is not the case. Instead, we are forced to live together and pretend to have shared interests, when in reality, our value systems are completely different. Our leaders post-independence had the best opportunity IMO to course-correct when the nation was still young, and the paradigms of national identity were still unset, green and supple. But they squandered it because they were ill prepared to tackle the issues that we were bound to face shortly. Corruption became the order of the day, everyone gave up the task of nation-building for the opportunity to have a piece of the juicy cake that is Nigeria's wealth.",
                    "Give me examples of countries that have such a large diversity of ethnic nationalities like Nigeria, that doesn't have the kinds of problems we have. Don't say America cuz I live there now, and I can tell you they are already having problems. Don't say England either, because that is a monarchy, and a few people have been calling the shots since time memorial.",
                    "Tbh, you are very correct. I do think \"tribalism\" is natural though. At the end of the day, its one persons \"family\" vs another persons \"family\". If Nigeria was somehow more homogeneous, or at least religiously homogeneous there would be less conflict. Managing vastly different cultures is extremely challenging, especially for a young 3rd world country.",
                    "You know what, it is OK if individuals think every man for himself. That's why we have governments. It is the responsibility of government to think for everyone and do what is best for everyone. Where we as Nigerians have a huge problem is in the fact that our government itself is also tribal.",

                    "Great comment! You had some terrific insights  and I never thought of the possibility of Nigeria divided differently. Food for thought. However I disagree with this statement. \"Tribalism breeds mistrust, selfishness, and greed.\" I think it's the other way around, that selfishness, greed and a mistrustful nature cause tribalism. Nigerians are a selfish people, you can see this in our relations even with people from the same tribe and even amongst family members. No Nigerians asked to be in what we currently call Nigeria, we did not historically interact with each other but we should make the best of a weird situation and as higher beings capable of thought look beyond who can speak the same dialect with you and allow the better angels of ethics and morality guide our behaviour but it seems that is much too difficult for our lizard brains to comprehend. Having as many different cultures as we do is a hurdle but it's not insurmountable we can even use it to our advantage as long as everyone is willing to play fair and learn from history, I won't hold my breath.",
                    "I understand what you're saying.",
                    "\" Nigerians are a selfish people,  Nigerians are humans so the \"selfishness\" we may display isn't inherently worse in us than in others, I think the selfishness is expressed because of the nature of the way Nigeria was designed. It's a rat race of which group can control the resources, because no one wants to be at the bottom. It's even worse when people aren't educated in ethics.  It manifests through corruption and ends up looking like what we have today.",
                    "I'm not so idealistic, I think there will always be idiots, unstable and \"bad\" people who will try to steal and behave in a corrupt way. I think a way forward for Nigeria is educating the every day man in things that will be useful for  himself and the Land. As well as giving average people value, proper rights and something worth fighting for. .... (jobs, homes, families...etc).",

                    "Regardless, the point I was making is that the people have a lot more in common as far as their shared history goes than we do. And even then, they are still having issues. What do you think about the Scottish referendum from a couple of years ago?",

He couldn't go to war without the support of the nobility, and he couldn't slaughter his citizens on a whim and without due process. Concepts which are basic today but were foreign then, and they absolutely did limit the powers of the king.",

Kingdom of England was always the most influential and powerful kingdom (at least since 1066) on the island. 1st Act of Union between England and Scotland forms Britain (because the main island is called the British Isles). 2nd Act of Union between England, Scotland and Ireland forms United Kingdom, because Ireland isn't the British isles.

There are tribal issues and I think in Nigeria tribalism is a source of many of our issues, but funny you should pick that case study. You wanna know why that referendum was so close ? The economic crash and austerity. Turns out people become more tribal and more xenophobic when they are poor.

All that money, what is being done for these people?Have the state government been able to invest in land reclamation projects? What have they done to improve the drainage systems? These are the things that directly impact the lives of the poor. Millions of people live in poverty. Millions of them are under the threat of insecurity. Millions of them live in places that you'd only deem fit for your worst enemy. That is no miracle, man.We shouldnt call underperformance a miracle.",

But I still stand by my opinion that Lagos is underperforming and it is that way mostly because of poor governance.If you eliminated the overppopulation and migration issues and kept the same leaders, Lagos would still have the problems we see in states like Cross River and Bayelsa: Wealth but nothing much to show for it. And this is directly as a result of mismanagement and poor leadership.But if you look at it from that perspective, you can easily come to the conclusion that it is a general problem with Nigeria and not Lagos alone. But then again, if we all agree that Nigeria is underperforming and not living up to potential, why save Lagos from that same criticism? Well...Let's just agree to disagree though.",

When you factor in what happened in the French revolution from the same period, it was clear to the monarchy and everyone else that they had to do something otherwise they would have a riot on their hands. From this point, the relationship with the monarchy was brought down to the level of the common man, not just the nobles, I would argue. They became a constitutional monarchy, but a monarchy is still a monarchy.",

In Nigeria, we also have traditional monarchs. if you go to any constituency of a monarch, you will often find people working in harmony to achieve goals. Greed and selfishness will often take the back seat to the task of achieving a common good.",
                    "Most multi-ethnic states with similar traits to Nigeria are failed states (or not very stable ones). Nigeria has a bunch of different ethnicities clashing at each other for oïl money and the likes. Look at the Ogoni whose land has been abused by the hydrocarbon industry - what do they have to show for their ancestors' land now being a giant lifeless waste disposal site? Nothing. The Igbo elite in the area took the money to enrich themselves. The poor Igbo man received nothing though. Similar stories can be heard all over Nigeria. Corrupt tribalistic elites grabbing resources for themselves. Nigeria will continue on the same corrupt path until the entire country is assimilated into one ethnicity: \"Nigerian\". This will take centuries most likely. So yeah, one can could easily claim that tribalism is the single biggest cause as to why Nigeria is not a functional country.",

                    "Thanks for your comment. I'd like to add that although none of our forefathers chose to be a part of this odd conglomeration we call Nigeria we can choose how we act in it, we can CHOOSE not to enrich ourselves at the expense of other people even if they don't speak the same language as you. We can choose to treat every person with dignity and a clean heart even if you can profit incredibly and never have to deal with that person again. It's the choosing to act morally, that's the part where Nigerians are struggling with. Whether that's made worse by having lots of tribes is indeterminable and really doesn't matter if you're god-fearing like most Nigerians claim to be.",
                    "True - it's always a choice. Nigeria is unfortunately corrupt through-and-through, so we're past the stage where corruption and greed could be dealt with relatively effectively. Corruption is reproduced in every corner of society nowadays; materialism, personal gain (and the list goes on), are all central themes in many Nigerian minds. It's easy to treat your neighbour as trash when there are no cultural/societal restraints or sanctions in the works for when one member of a tribe abuses a person of another.",

However I disagree with this statement. \"Tribalism breeds mistrust, selfishness, and greed.\" I think it's the other way around, that selfishness, greed and a mistrustful nature cause tribalism. Nigerians are a selfish people, you can see this in our relations even with people from the same tribe and even amongst family members. No Nigerians asked to be in what we currently call Nigeria, we did not historically interact with each other but we should make the best of a weird situation and as higher beings capable of thought look beyond who can speak the same dialect with you and allow the better angels of ethics and morality guide our behaviour but it seems that is much too difficult for our lizard brains to comprehend. Having as many different cultures as we do is a hurdle but it's not insurmountable we can even use it to our advantage as long as everyone is willing to play fair and learn from history, I won't hold my breath.",

Nigeria has a bunch of different ethnicities clashing at each other for oïl money and the likes. Look at the Ogoni whose land has been abused by the hydrocarbon industry - what do they have to show for their ancestors' land now being a giant lifeless waste disposal site? Nothing. The Igbo elite in the area took the money to enrich themselves. The poor Igbo man received nothing though. Similar stories can be heard all over Nigeria. Corrupt tribalistic elites grabbing resources for themselves. Nigeria will continue on the same corrupt path until the entire country is assimilated into one ethnicity: \"Nigerian\". This will take centuries most likely. So yeah, one can could easily claim that tribalism is the single biggest cause as to why Nigeria is not a functional country.",

I'd like to add that although none of our forefathers chose to be a part of this odd conglomeration we call Nigeria we can choose how we act in it, we can CHOOSE not to enrich ourselves at the expense of other people even if they don't speak the same language as you. We can choose to treat every person with dignity and a clean heart even if you can profit incredibly and never have to deal with that person again. It's the choosing to act morally, that's the part where Nigerians are struggling with. Whether that's made worse by having lots of tribes is indeterminable and really doesn't matter if you're god-fearing like most Nigerians claim to be.",

                    "Ah, naija. As someone who practiced medicine in Nigeria, it's a depressing read and it's frustrating how people think money and God directly fixes all things. This is why the epidemic is going to hit a lot of 'rich' Nigerians too who don't know how bad it is in America. Like alcohol, rich people easily use more drugs, they just hide it better (or as \"family secrets\"). Money helps to cushion the effects but fixing systemic issues with inequality and corruption is the best safeguard we have as a society.",
                    "Inequality (and corruption) are the first problems we need to address not promoting a society chasing more money to the ruin of our culture that used to keep people and communities together. Drug use is also a product of increasing lack of social mobility and social isolation. But if you tell Nigerians, even the traditional ones, that you need to fix inequality and corruption to address addiction, they scoff and cite the Wealth of Nations (without having a clue of its relevance)."

                    "I don't think Saraki will just pull a story like that out of his ass. My guess is, he knows something is being cooked up against him. He also knows that whatever it is, there is probably some truth to it. Regardless, he understands that if he allows the story to break on its own, it could get out of hand and damage his public image. Everyone knows he has designs on the presidency someday, so he clearly isn't going to let it happen. What I think he is doing here is that he is trying to break the story first. This way, he can control the narrative and ensure that it works in his favor. Classic House of Cards move.",
                    "Saraki is actually a very smart guy. And by that I mean he is more clever than your average Nigerian politician. If he didn't have such a bad reputation already, and he wasn't so tainted, I'll be honest, I actually think he has the intellectual capacity to run the country.",

He also knows that whatever it is, there is probably some truth to it. Regardless, he understands that if he allows the story to break on its own, it could get out of hand and damage his public image. Everyone knows he has designs on the presidency someday, so he clearly isn't going to let it happen. What I think he is doing here is that he is trying to break the story first. This way, he can control the narrative and ensure that it works in his favor. Classic House of Cards move.",

It would be best if you can go to an African market of somekind if you are really interested in finding original stuff and the relevant ornaments to complete your look. If you can't find any there you will certainly find a Nigerian who knows someone that can hook you up (search long and hard for a pattern that speaks to you and DON'T be afraid to haggle). That person will likely know (or be) a tailor who will make the agbada for you (for a price again don't be afraid to haggle). Nigerians generally don't mind any person making and wearing the agbada it is just fancy clothing and it doesn't have any special importance beyond that to my knowledge. I encourage you to make it and wear it, don't worry if you're a white person, Nigerians generally enjoy pictures of other people revelling in our culture. Have fun and share photos when you're done!

What's to stop INEC from forging it for candidates themselves?The problem is not with the laws, but with the people who are supposed to uphold and enforce these laws.",

The idea is not to nit-pick everything that could be wrong, but instead to flag any potentially dangerous condition that could lead to incompetence in performing duties. Terminal cancer would be an obvious example. This is what I think PMB has btw, just to put it out there. I know it can be difficult, but there has to be a way to solve this.",
                    "At the end of the day, it has to come down to public awareness and willingness to do what may be difficult, but necessary. For instance, I think it is ludicrous that the president has not revealed any details about his condition.",

                    "Roosevelt did not hide his polio from anyone. He was in a wheelchair! That would be hard to hide from anyone. Roosevelt was president during a time when people didn't have TV, and public address systems were restricted to newspapers (without photos) and radio. Most people didn't even know what their president looked like aside from the occasional photo-op. You could argue that he may not have wanted everyone to see him in a wheelchair for fear that they might think him weakened, but I don't think he went out of his way to hide anything.",
                    "I agree about Churchhill. but Churchhill had a stroke towards the end of his tenure. Plus, Churchhill had a long track record of excellent leadership, and he certainly wasn't looking to recontest any elections towards the end of his appointment.",
                    "It is true that JFK had health problems that really could have presented problems as far as his competence to hold office went. But at least he took the immense effort needed to keep up appearances of good health. Trust me, JFK would have had huge problems with public confidence if he was taking the kinds of long medical vacations that PMB frequently does.",

                    "No, I really don't see your point. I don't think it is ok for elected leaders to lie about their health to citizens, especially if their health condition can get in the way of doing their work. An argument can be made for problems that arise during the presidency, but even those should be treated carefully on a case by case basis. To suggest that illness does not get in the way of presidential duties is dangerously confident. And no, taking 103 days off to see your doctor should not be acceptable to anyone who considers himself a responsible citizen, political opponent or not.",

No matter the atrocities committed, we will still find a way to celebrate tyrants or human rights abusers for the simple fact that they are or have been in power. This is a man that profited and made his fortune, got his standing by selling slaves but we still find something to celebrate.",

The Musuem and the surrounding area is not well cared for, at all. Some of the artifacts were just left out in the air, there was no light. It was a real shame and that’s not even to mention to journey to get there. Visiting just put me in a really sober mood.",

You see people condemning office holders and politicians all the time, but given the opportunity, these same people will go to any length to receive handouts and approval from the \"evil politicians\".It is so rampant that it almost feels like an inherent thing at this point. Like it's something in our DNA. This is a major reason why we can't move forward.You see this manifest in many ways. You see people like Babangida and even Abacha being held in high regard because reasons. I have heard many people praise Abacha and say he is one of our best presidents because \"he did well for the economy\" and \"dealt with criminals\". From Presidents even down to governors, Local Government Chairmen and permanent secretaries. We are always ready to pander to people who contribute to the deaths of thousands of Nigerians yearly, sponsor thugs, ruin our country, perform rituals and steal. How can we be so ill-minded and desperate? No conscience. As long as you have money and power, you have a clean slate regardless of what you have done and continue to do.Yet we have real heroes and activists like Ganni Fawehinmi ignored by the people because he was essentially and relatively a nobody.

Problem is there's only a handfull of us subscribed to here now (compared to what you'd find on a more popular platform like FB) and much less regular visitors. If she's doing that, I think she'd expect a reasonable audience/participation. So instead of using the AMA to draw traffic (which will still work), we may want to find another way to attract users first, get the place busy then go for it. The AMA will further populate the sub going forward.",

Saraki has a decent albeit unlikely shot at beating him.In the general elections, two likely candidates from the PDP are Atiku Abubakar (former Vice President) and Ahmed Makarfi (former governor of Kaduna state). Both have GOOD chances at beating him since they are more popular in the south than the current President. They are also from the north and may give the president a run for his money when it comes to amassing votes in that part of the country.Another contender is Omoyele Sowore who is attempting to bring together the smaller parties under one umbrella to stand against the big TWO parties who have been recycling the same individuals in government positions for decades (both during the military and previous civilian governments). Sowore is very popular among the \"woke\" population although he has ZERO chance of winning in my opinion. Lol.",

Movies like No Country For Old Men come to mind.Like you said in an earlier comment, many Nollywood movies are all about getting a moral lesson across all at the expense of a rich plot and some strong dialogue. Other characters besides the protagonists and antagonists are just there for the ride most times and hardly get any character development.Nollywood needs better stories. Almost every single movie revolves around romance and crime/rituals. I'd love to see more drama, more personal stories that don't have romance as the main plot.",

And for the longest time, this info was not even public knowledge, despite how people have been asking for it. There are also more senators per citizen than even the US, which is crazy.",

Some show up and just sleep. The few that show up and speak hardly say anything we care about.",

The establishment candidate was Clinton.",
                    "When Trump first stated his interest in running for office, people were laughing at him on national TV. Even here in Nigeria, back in 2015. Every law in the books stated that Jonathan should have won. But he lost because the will of the people took over.

If people turn out to vote for a candidate that promises to change the status quo, I promise you he will win.",

Most of them are just corrupt politicians and ex-governors detached from their people who use the senate as some sort of source for retirement fumds.The whole \"senatorial district\" thing is nebulous since Nigeria is way too diverse for most regions to be grouped under a senatorial district. Federal Constituencies are so much better since they are narrowed down to very specific areas meaning Reps have a lot more connection to the grassroots.Scrap the Senate completely and use only the House of Reps."

It looked like you were going one way at first, and then you pivot in a different direction to talk about masquerades and Orishas, and then you finally come to talk about the state of the nation as it relates to the recent comments by the president, which I suspect is where you were going.",

                    "Otherwise, strong content. I agree with what you have said about tribal/ethnic identity taking the back seat to national identity. I think it is the only we can move forward as a nation. I also think we should be more committed to the task of building the nation, and stop leaving the job to the political class alone. They are no more equipped or enlightened than we are.",

                    "Edit: AFAIK it's only in North Korea that the government aka Great Leader gets treated like a God and they're far from the model of opportunity and adequate services.",
                    "What I mean is people deferring all their personal responsibility to the government.This definitely happens in the West.Europe is slowly turning into a nanny state.The UK is already a nanny state, personal liberties are getting smaller and smaller.",
                    "Some will always try to game the system but saying most or all is ridiculous hyperbole. Having universal healthcare, subsidized or free college education, and protection from discrimination and hateful activities are the cornerstone of a peaceful, vibrant, and progressive nation. I don't know what personal liberties you think are getting stifled, but you don't know what you're talking about. Get your head out of your ass. Better a \"nanny state\" than the greedy incompetent criminal mess that's the Nigerian government.",

Evidence shows that those benefits make a happier population, the post the whole discussion is based on backs it up. There's a reason why social democracies such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark consistently rank near the top for happiness and even educational achievement. They remain competitive compared to other countries despite competing less with each other and helping one another along.",
                    "You seem to have the same bullshit libertarian view as US Republicans that are staunchly against anything that might improve the lives of citizenship while kowtowing to big bigness. That's why I told you to get your head out of your ass, because you're not considering the evidence and as a result are not making an intelligent argument. Freedoms are nice but they must be curtailed when they interfere with those of other people or become a nuisance. The UK doesn't have personal liberties codified like the US does but is freer where it matters (people aren't getting shot dead for inadvertently disobeying trigger happy cops).",
                    "No one is a pillar. You seem blissfully unaware that a person that is healthy, happy, and has the resources to progress is more likely to contribute more to society than they received rather than being a burden. Education and healthcare are actually cheaper when universal. I use universal because people are paying for it in taxes, it's just that money isn't being wasted as much and payment isn't as crippling when compared to individuals paying out of pocket. The US has about the highest maternal death rate of the developed world along with other indicators of poor healthcare. You know why? Because many people only visit the doctor when they're at death's door because of how unnecessarily expensive it is. Tell me how universal healthcare is debatable again when you don't need to worry about seeing a doctor for that migraine that might be a tumor.",
                    "Seriously, from your views I really have a hard time believing you aren't American and have any link to Nigeria. Americans have convinced themselves that working themselves to the bone and being practically indentured servants is necessary to maintain that mirage of patriotic independence. While other developed countries manage to have a healthy balance while protecting against tyrannical practices and still manage to do better.",
                    "scandinavian americans have a better standard of living than actual scandinavians.US healthcare is expensive because of corruption,not freemarkets.Relatively Low level of taxation is a huge reason why america has the best economic mobility in the advanced world.You conviniently ignore population sizes of the countries you cite.",
                    "No im based here in lagos but i would say i subscribe to the idea of the government being as small as possible.",
                    "The UK isnt freer than the US in safety.Gun free London has more murders than New York.The US is not a trigger happy country-thats just media sensationalism.Youre less likely to be burgled in America than UK.",

The whole point of having a government is to take care of people. That is why government's are created, so certain things can be controlled and adequately distributed by an authorized body instead of by the citizens. What you are advocating for can best be described as an absolute monarchy or an autocracy. Where the government essentially does what it wants absent of the needs and will of the people/subjects.",
                    "The irony here is that even in this modern age, the few absolute monarchies that continue to exist know not to embody this kind of mindset, because it obvious that the moment you do that you lose your legitimacy as an authority.",
                    "Lol, I'm always fascinated by Conservative/Republican blacks. It seems such a paradox to believe in a party and ideology that sees you as subhuman. I've met Nigerians that support Trump because apparently Obama singlehandedly made gay marriage legal. Clearly that's evil and he's the devil. A Haitian in the US that voted for Trump because apparently Hillary was responsible for their earthquakes and cholera outbreak. I just can't grasp that mindset. It's like a jew being a Nazi."

What you are advocating for can best be described as an absolute monarchy or an autocracy. Where the government essentially does what it wants absent of the needs and will of the people/subjects.",

I'm an International Relations student at the University of Michigan in the United States, and I'm trying to better understand Lagos from a perspective that looks at the social impacts of transportation. For instance, the displacement of vulnerable citizens along the Blue Line corridor, and what their options might be.",
                    "I was wondering if there are any Lagosians or anyone else who's got any opinions on this kind of topic who might be willing to help me better understand it? It's so hard to find reliable information on the internet, and nothing beats engaging with people who actually live the story I'm trying to learn.",
                    "Do any of you have any sense of what a good solution to Lagos' traffic and congestion problems would look like? What's standing in the way? What are your opinions of LAMATA, Tinubu, Fashola, e.g.? I'm genuinely curious, and don't want to rely on academic journal articles that are out of date and biased towards big business.",

Everyone hated it, and thought it was not going to work. People don't like the status quo to change as they are not sure if it will mean good things for them. You see, many citizens are still traumatized from the days of the military rule and have a heightened level of distrust of the gov't.",
                    "Now the blue lines work and everyone seems to enjoy it.",
                    "Lagos is the economic capital of Nigeria and has been that way since before independence. Owing to its privileged status during colonial times, combined with its prime location next to the ocean, it's probably going to enjoy its class status for a long time. That said, Lagos has also enjoyed a track record of relatively good, and consistent leadership, particularly from the dawn of the 4th republic. For one thing, it has been ruled by the same political party since for the last 20 odd years, and there aren't signs that will change soon. This has allowed it's political elite come up with elaborate long term plans for the state that they have been able to implement for the most part.",
                    "Tinubu laid most of the ground work for making Lagos into the state that it is today. Unfortunately, many people will not remember him for great things in the state because he had a reputation for being a bully sometimes. But he was smart, and he had a vision. He did embark on many major projects, but many of his works were mostly foundational. He also played a huge role in mentoring and placing the next set of governors for the state. Many have criticized him for this as he essentially plays Godfather. But at least he seems to have played his cards right so far, and Lagos is better for it.",
                    "Lagos needs a revolution in transportation. Short term, I think they need to change the main vehicles of transportation. Currently, they use mostly the yellow and black volkwagen vans. If you have watched Avengers: Civil war, you will see the buses at the intro. These are very low capacity and simply cannot sufficient for the long term. There needs to be a wholesale transition from these to larger capacity long buses. Probably even the articulated ones that are used in many US downtown areas.",
                    "Long term, I think the government should also look into some kind of light rail system to cover mid-range distances across the city. Similar to places like NY city, LA or even Tokyo. That's pretty ambitious, even for Lagos, but I think it can be done.",
                    "Finally, Lagos is essentially an island. There is an abundance of water ways that I think are simply going under utilized right now. This can be put to use and I think it will help a lot.",
                    "Finally finally, other states in the country really need to start catching up and building up their own economic centers as well. Lagos will keep getting congested if attempts are not made to by other states to reduce the burden.",
                    "Hello John, well the main problem with Lagos's transportation stems from overpopulation in both the state and the country. Too many people moving to Lagos because they feel there are more economic opportunities there than in other states. Well yeah, Lagos is more developed than other states.",
                    "Solution: Corruption is somehow a cause of this problem. I mean if a lot of states in Nigeria were more developed and have better opportunities a lot of people wouldn't be trooping into Lagos. And unfortunately there are no laws to make/force leaders to perform effectively. If there can be, the issues will probably be resolved and at least alleviated.",
                    "I will say to introduce more buses to make things easier but that would probably still not meet the needs of the people. So,...",
                    "I don't know much about LAMATA but I can say Fashola would ever be commended and remembered for introducing the BRTs in Lagos. It was definitely a progressive move in the transport system and he also made navigation easier in the state.",
                    "Tinubu?? Err I don't remember much about his regime.",
                    "Hope this helps.",

                    "Buhari made many promises, true. Many of them he has not fulfilled. But that is not uncommon. Every politician does it. What should matter is how committed they are to fulfilling as many of them as they can.",
                    "Plus, I know the article is long. But if you read it, you will see the author is trying to make the case that PMB may not be perfect, but if he had to make a choice between PMB and PDP, he would go with PMB.",
                    "I read the article and to God that was awful.  Anyone with  a brain would know it is a paid writeup. I don't want to talk about this but one thing that I'll say is that we have entered election period so there will be all sorts of news in circulation. The only thing I'll say is go out and ask 10 random people and I can guarantee you that at least 7 of them want him out. And when you see a reaction like that from the Nigerian mass what does that tell you about the current state of the Nation",
                    "You make a fair point. I confess I may not be skilled at identifying paid write-ups. I don't know about the statistic you mention though.",
                    "I'll be honest, I am not his biggest fan, I think his age is a big problem, but I really do think he is trying to do a good job. Why do people not like him so much? I am confused.",
                    "but I really do think he is trying to do a good job.",

                    "Why do people not like him so much? I am confused",
                    "Simple, he failed the people. It's the same thing that happened with Jonathan. People believed in him, turned out and voted and in the end, he ended up being no different from anyone else.The country is stagnant in almost every way.What has he done to improve the dire unemployment levels?How has he improved critical infrastructure?What has been his response to the growing insecurity?What has he done to revitalize the refineries and Ajaokuta?Have his policies benefitted the agricultural sector? Has he done anything to make manufacturing in Nigeria easier?Who are the people he has appointed to head key government offices, ministries and agencies and how have they fared?Is he connected to the plight of Nigerians?  If so, how has he reacted to the suffering and poverty?What has he done to pull the country together and quell ethnic and religious tensions?How has he managed to stabilize local politics and what is his relationship with the governors?Have security agencies, the legislature, the judiciary and several parastatals improved their efficiency under him?What progress has been made in fighting corruption in terms of important prosecutions and prevention of looting?",
                    "If you can give me at least 5 positive answers to any these questions, then I will go out and vote for Buhari next year.",
                    "People believed in him, turned out and voted and in the end, he ended up being no different from anyone else.",
                    "This is simply not true. You can say anything about Buhari, but saying he is the same as GEJ and his administration is flat out inaccurate.",
                    "I also find it interesting that people fully realize that many of the problems in the country are as a result of gross incompetence and mismanagement from the last 5 years of GEJ, yet, they are willing to lay most of those blame at the feet of PMB as well.",
                    "What has he done to improve the dire unemployment levels?",
                    "You say this like he is just going to pluck people off the street and start paying them for singing sai Buhari. Job creation is as much (if not more) a responsibility of the private sector, as it is of the public sector. Creating the kind of environment that fosters job creation and low unemployment numbers takes a great deal of time and capital investment. I'm sure you know this. And with a country as big as Nigeria with such high youth unemployment numbers, it will take even longer. The NPOWER program is an intervention on government level where they are trying to increase entrepreneurs. The long-term goal here is to hopefully encourage the kind of private sector growth that can improve the unemployment burden.",
                    "At least his government has resolved not to borrow money to pay civil servants, which is far more than can be said for the previous government.",
                    "His gov't has resolved to plug leakages and streamline government processes that often leave room for looting and embezzlement. We know this to be true because many close to power that used to get free money are now complaining. Money doesn't flow like it used to, which by the way I think is another reason people are complaining. Many Nigerians had grown accustomed to a malignant system of financial hand-me-downs from people in power. Everyone had a big uncle somewhere they could easily get a couple hundred thou from when things are tight. That is no longer the case.",
                    "Have his policies benefitted the agricultural sector?",
                    "Yes, it has! There are several ongoing initiatives to improve Nigerians food and cash crop footprint. Nigeria reduced rice importation. Rice importation in neighboring countries like Benin have increased to bolster the failing rice smuggling market That used to be legitimate not too long ago. The government has implemented loan programs to small farmers to increase their production capacity. Many young people are thinking of going into Agric because they see that the government is serious about revamping that sector. I spoke to one of such people on this sub not long age.",
                    "Is he connected to the plight of Nigerians? If so, how has he reacted to the suffering and poverty?",
                    "Yes, he is! He may not be as Charismatic and given to public show of affection as his vice is. But he does his own little things. He approved gov't bail out TWICE for civil servants in states that could not pay salaries. This, after stating that money was tight, and the government really needed to focus on other priorities. Outside of giving handouts to people on the street (which is a terrible idea). I am not sure what a president can do to improve the plight of the hungry people on the street than to implement sustainable policies and set achievable goals for improving the economy, and cash flow. Again, the common man cannot be blamed for expecting a president to act like an all-powerful king next to God. It's as if most people think that with the flick of a wand, or tap of a finger, the president can just turn things around radically. I think technocrats and the educated elite have a responsibility to use their knowledge about how things really work to make sure that the government is focused on the right goals for achieving sustainable development.",
                    "Bad players in PDP have started to pander to the lowest common denominator issues affecting the masses. They mention hunger, unemployment, suffering as if they can do better. I think this is BS and should not be encouraged.",
                    "What progress has been made in fighting corruption in terms of important prosecutions and prevention of looting?",
                    "His government has made it very obvious that is wants to end wanton looting and embezzlement of state resources. Merely with his stance alone, PMB had managed to get the message across. Even his opponentst know this. The VP never stops talking about looting from the previous adminstration. They recently published a looters list. More are probably coming. The only defense the opposition has mustered is that they money was used to fund the APC campaign.",
                    "At the risk of losing significant political capital, he has supported the appointment of Magu as acting head of EFCC against the explicit disapproval by the Senate. He wouldn't do this if he wasn't serious.",
                    "Agreed, he has also made some very questionable choices when talking about fighting corruption.",
                    "He has failed in most of the other areas you mention.",
                    "Well you have made fair points. But as long as he failing woefully in the other areas and as long as there aren't any signs of improvement, he deserves to go.",
                    "Trying to do a good job you say?  Emphasis on \"trying to\".",
                    "Have you read the news lately? About the senseless killings all over the place? About the obvious bias towards a certain group of persons who were tagged terrorists despite having not taken up arms or hurt anybody? While a certain armed militia is allowed to roam freely, to maim and kill as they please?",
                    "About the \"wonderful\" corruption fight, where all those in a certain ruling party are saints? About the countless scandals and money laundering cases that have been swept under the carpet because they happen to have ties to the ruling party?",
                    "Go to any market in southern Nigeria and declare support for his reelection bid, see how far you'd go.",
                    "I have since changed my view from the time I posted this article.",
                    "I no longer think He should be president.",
                    "I have just seen how out of touch he really is. No matter how good-intentioned he is, an out of touch president is always going to be dangerous.",
                    "The person is not feeling recession. You all may have forgotten the economy but I have not. APC got rid of all PDP top officials let PDP do the same so we can have a leveled play field."

                    "I have been thinking about attitudes toward the idea of having a 75-year-old man as a democratically elected president. This really isn't just about Buhari as an individual, but rather about a mindset that embraces blind patriarchy in the face of numerous geopolitical challenges that threaten to destabilize the nation. I have heard Buhari described as \"the father of the nation\", and I wonder to myself if people really know what it means to be a father of a nation, or if they use it as the term of affection for a dear over-the-hill baba who happens to be our leader.",
                    "Regarding his health, people have said things like \"anyone can get sick\", or \"only God knows who will be well, and who will get sick\". I see this as a load of BS. The kind of sentimental nonsense we tell ourselves when it is convenient. Anyone can't get sick. There is a reason why old people die when they are old. There is a reason there is a retirement age for civil servants and even regular folk. We allow a man we won't employ in our small establishments to lead the entire nation.",
                    "Anyways... just wanted sample thoughts. If he wins in 2019, he would be 79 by the end of his term.",
                    "Old is too old when your age begins to take a serious toll on your physical and mental competence.But that isn't the case with Buhari is it? At least I don't think so. He is just generally bad at everything. He is aloof, disconnected, nepotic and inept. If he had been 10 or 30 years younger, his government wouldn't have been any better.There's a narrative that in his first reign as head of state in the 80s, it was Tunde Idiagbon that was running the government behind the scenes as \"Baba\" was too dull to do anything and was just there for the ride. Every day that passes, that seems to have more truth in it.There were several warning signs before the Babangida coup but he failed to see them and even ignored warnings from western governments. So you can see the dullness and stagnation we see from Buhari today didnt start all of a sudden. It's always been a part of him.My point is, age does matter but that isn't the problem with Buhari at all. I still do feel that we could do better with a younger leader who is in touch with the needs and problems of the current generation. A younger leader would also be more willing to learn and surround himself with good, efficient people unlike a lot of the old, arrogant folk we have around today.",
                    "Trump is 71, Hillary is 69, Bernie Sanders is just as old.Age isn't the issue, talent and ideas are.Young leaders can be stubborn ideologues sometimes which isn't good for the country",
                    "I knew someone would say this. Age is totally the issue.",
                    "Look at Trump now. The guy can't even take a bite out of his food without embarrasing his country on the world stage. He can't even sneeze without saying something so catastrophically stupid as to make people gag. You might say, \"well, that's just Trump, that's the way he has always been\". But I can show you an interview he did in the late 80s where he was talking about politics, here - https://youtu.be/SEPs17_AkTI?t=58s. He is still the same pompous guy we have come to know today, but at least he sounded way more intelligent. I am not saying old people grow dumb and should not be taken seriously. but if I had to vote, and I had to choose between that guy and the Trump of today, I'd go with that guy every time.",
                    "Also, you should think in terms of averages. Yes Trump is 71, but the past 3 were in their late 40s when elected.",
                    "If you are too frail to put your talents to use, then what really is the point. Buhari's health is failing him, and it is obvious to everyone. He looks thinner. His mentation has slowed considerably.",
                    "Age isn't the issue, talent and ideas are.Young leaders can be stubborn ideologues sometimes which isn't good for the country",
                    "It is quite possible to have really good ideas as an old person, or a young person. The problem is ideas tend to grow old, and that's why leaders step down and let other people take over. Examples are Jerry Rawlings, Nelson Mandela. And then we have Robert Mugabe who had great ideas as a young revolutionary leader and put those ideas to good use. But he stayed in power for too long, and watched the fruit of his work slowly decline into ruin.",

                    "Well, there are several examples of Nigerian athletes for example who have trained outside the country and want to represent Nigeria. They are either shunned outright or otherwise told to fund or find sponsors for themselves. Many of these people will go on to other endeavors and won't fulfill their dreams because they don't have a platform",
                    "Anthony Joshua is the most famous boxer in the world right now. Ben Murray Bruce came out after his victory over Klitschko stating that the federal gov't should try and embrace him as a national hero. Of course, he refused. What many don't know is that this dude had approached the Nigerian government back when he was just starting, and he was a nobody. They shunned him. Nobody would sponsor him.",
                    "There are many examples of athletes who have represented Nigeria in the Olympics who have had to sponsor themselves to participate because Nigeria does not give 2 shits. The most recent bob-sled girls come to mind. There was this other girl from a few years back who represented us in rowing. She had to sponsor herself.",
                    "I don't have many examples in the world of showbiz cuz quite frankly there aren't many successful diasporan actors who want to embrace Nollywood. What Boyega is doing right now is highly commendable because the dude is really famous right now. He recently won the rising star award in Bafta. Everyone in Hollywood wants to cast him. He also recently started producing his own movies. And I doubt if he is 25 yet.",
                    "He is willing to put his marketability and social capital to work to get Nigerian movies to Hollywood standard. In his most recent work , Pacific Rim, he used Wizkid song and wore a Nigerian print pajamas. He didn't have to do that, but he did because he really wants to associate his ethnic and national pride with his work. The guy really wants to embrace Nigeria, and if Nollywood knew how marketable and popular this guy is, they would gladly embrace him back, without hesitation.",

Something I'd like to add is that Nigeria/most Nigerians are somehow content with mediocre products and outright incompetence. When smart Nigerians want to come back and make some very effective changes in whatever company or field of their profession, Nigerians are threatened. So I commend Boyega for his patriotism but I'm sure Nollywood will stifle any effort he makes to improve the production standard because Nigerians accept subpar performance and products.",

This guy was the PRESIDENT of the body that regulates and licenses engineer and he was also a civil engineer but he failed to explain the basic principles involved in road design and construction, drainage considerations for runoff water, etc.",

What you've just said about education is so on point. You have strikes every other semester in Nigerian colleges because the government is having a hard time subsidizing tertiary education. But yet our public primary and secondary schools are in the worst state they have ever been. In other nations, the situation is reversed. i.e government subsidizes primary and secondary education, and then tertiary is funded by alumni and individuals.",
                    "In Nigeria, most things that should work don't work, and when they do work, they work in reverse. It's so shameful. This is why Nigerians can't afford to sit on the sidelines and hope the political class will wake up one day and do the right thing. The suffering Nigerians are suffering today is as a result of the investments that were not made 20, 30 years ago. Fela Kuti was singing about the problems we are facing right now 30 years ago. If Nigerians had stood up then, and demanded better leadership, we would be better for it today.",

Something I'd like to add is that Nigeria/most Nigerians are somehow content with mediocre products and outright incompetence. When smart Nigerians want to come back and make some very effective changes in whatever company or field of their profession, Nigerians are threatened. So I commend Boyega for his patriotism but I'm sure Nollywood will stifle any effort he makes to improve the production standard because Nigerians accept subpar performance and products.",

What you've just said about education is so on point. You have strikes every other semester in Nigerian colleges because the government is having a hard time subsidizing tertiary education. But yet our public primary and secondary schools are in the worst state they have ever been. In other nations, the situation is reversed. i.e government subsidizes primary and secondary education, and then tertiary is funded by alumni and individuals.",

                    "Honestly the last 11 months were not a joke. I don’t know how many times I wanted to literally quit NYSC but I kept reminding myself why I actually started..•Why? Because you just never know when Nigerians want to make your life miserable in the future. On the positive note, I learnt a lot about the way of life in this country..•Got to experience going to a state without an airport in its near vicinity. Got to experience what it’s like to be in the deepest jungle bush where even google maps imaging cannot capture the road.•Got to experience how deeply ingrained corruption and indiscipline is in Nigerians from young to old. Got to experience how simple queueing, is not possible... Over and over again..•Respect rarely exists. Humility rarely exists. Shame equally rarely exists. Self-Interest exists. Before anyone gets hurt by this finding, honestly there’s a big difference between poor and middle class not to talk of upper class..•They say Nigeria has a high number of graduates, I say Nigeria has a high number of graduates who were not taught quality education and lack basic common sense..•They say the problem with Nigeria is it’s old leaders, I say Nigeria faces an even bigger problem when the young already show traits of the older generation clinging on to power..•For the first time I got to fully interact with Nigerians from all walks of life and it has been a truly humbling experience. I am grateful to those who pushed me to do NYSC because now I know up until a year ago, I lived in a bubble when it came to ‘knowing’ my country.",
                    "I agree, it is poorly structured. But what do you think? Is this an accurate representation of the Nigerian people?",
                    "I disagree because she clearly hasn't met ALL types of Nigerians is she thinks that the younger generation is the problem. I don't mean to rant but just because she tasted a life different from her everyday routine for 11 months doesn't mean she knows what's wrong with the country.  It's much deeper than what she thinks she saw",
                    "Fair point. So, in your opinion, I'd like to know:•What is wrong with the country?•How do you feel the younger generation are different from the older generation purely in terms of character?",
                    "In my PERSONAL OPINION the main problem with this country is our forgetfulness, we tend to easily make a joke out of serious issues and when everyone starts laughing it fades out as if nothing happened,  take the snake incident for example.  Also most are fed up with the fact that the same leaders that were in our books in nursery school are still the ones there coupled with the painful fact that an average Nigerian will complain about how bad the country is but will casually tell you how he plans to \"chop his own share of the National cake\".  There's a lot more than meets the eye when it comes to our problems but hey the guys in power don't mind cause you don't matter.  So there's part of my wahala",

However, now experts and history agree that Nigeria needs to diversify their economy to have sustainable growth. And if you look at our numbers: energy is only 18% of gdp. Agriculture & trade are quickly growing. And with the young, educated population - the workforce has strong prospects for the future (good article here.",
                    "In terms of infrastructure, Eko Atlantic is probably the biggest. Every country needs a flash, ‘New York’, Ferris wheel-type city that acts as the face of tourism. That kind of blends into economy though",
                    "They are however building 28 new roads this year... that won’t fix the overpopulation in Lagos or urbanization and widespread poverty",
                    "I can go on and on. At the end of the day, we are an emerging country who desperately needs a consulting firm to guide an organized growth path. We just need strong leadership & I believe the younger generation will create that",

It would make the airport friendlier. It qould also improve the tourist sites it has. Ive seen some great sites here but they're chronically neglected."

But In reality, the whole Sahel region melts into the Sahara which cuts across several countries in the region including Chad, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Mali, Niger, and yes, Nigeria. Looking on the map, you might think Libya definitely doesn't have anything to do with us, but really, all that separates us is just SAND! Settlements are sparse, borders are like sieves. It really doesn't take much for illegal arms sales in Libya to be used for terrorism here in Nigeria.",

They do not bother with either raising ethic issues or respecting international law. Good PR together with brainwashing is really all it takes to achieve the established objectives.",
                    "History offers numerous examples of that approach. The US and UK road to total world domination is littered with corpses of unwanted politicians and ruins of their states. All accusations against Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milošević, and Muammar Gaddafi have turned out to be either false or baseless, but they served as the basis for military intervention in their countries with the tacit approval of a majority of the UN members. As a result, anarchy has reigned in these territories and no mentioned leader's case could come to the international court. Now, to all seeming, a similar fate awaits Syrian leader Bashar Assad. However, this has posed some difficulties.",
                    "It is well known that London's and Washington's efforts to enhance their hegemony are not limited to stove piping and charges that follow them. Control over allies, who are more or less dependent from the power players, plays an important role in that regard. Early last year, the US and UK representatives in NATO requested the Secretary General of NATO to exert influence on other members of the Alliance just prior to the UN vote on such sensitive issue for London as the Chagos Archipelago.",

The purpose of this event is to allow people from two different national communities to get and share knowledge about their respective cultures, daily life, history and curiosities. Exchange will run from April 10th. General guidelines:",
                    "Poles ask their questions about Nigeria here in r/Nigeria;",

                    "Questions can include anything including but not limited to politics, culture, lifestyle and history;",
                    "Event will be moderated, following the general rules of Reddiquette. Be nice!",
                    "Hi! Wikipedia entry on the languages of Nigeria opens with the supremely unhelpful \"There are over 520 languages spoken in Nigeria.\" It also adds that main one is English. So how does that work in practice? What languages do you actually use in your daily life and how many do you know?",
                    "It works quite easily. English is taught is schools from the primary level and almost everyone in the urban and semi-urban centers knows how to speak it.Nigeria is multiethnic and the only way to avoid added ethnic tension and ensure seamless communication with each other would be to use English. Learning all the languages would be a nightmare. So I guess you could say the introduction of English by the colonialists was a blessing. There is also pidgin or broken English which is a lot more common and more widely spoken especially among the illiterate/semi-literate group. Pidgin is just like an informal form of English that is mixed with urban lingua and and a dose of phrases and words from many indigineous Nigerian languages.Most people in the country are bilingual, able to communicate in their indigineous languages (with their fellow tribesmen) and in English/Pidgin English (with everyone else).",
                    "So usually it goes:•Use your local language with your tribesmen and family members.•Use pidign in casual discussions and daily interactions.•Use English in schools and official settings.",
                    "I for example only speak two, my own language and English/pidgin English.",
                    "It is however very common to meet people who speak three or more languages. This is especially common with people in highly urbanized centers, people who grew up in a place that speaks a language different from that of the family they were born into (for example, a person born to Yoruba parents but growing up in a northern Nigerian city like Kano where Hausa is the main language would most likely be fluent in Yoruba, Hausa and English) and those from homes with inter-ethnic marriages.",

Both are former military heads of state. Some may even say Buhari - the current president - is the worst since he apparently locked up many \"corrupt politicians\" during his own reign as military head of stat, was an extreme disciplinarian and wasn't a fan of free speech himself. Another controversial one would be Odumegwu Ojokwu who some felt led millions of igbos to their slaughter in the Nigerian civil war because of greed and and ill-concieved attempt at secession.So really, it depend on who you ask.",

Religious clashes have always happened in states like Niger, Kano, Kaduna, Taraba and Plateau. But like I said, they've always been few and far between and nothing really on a large scale.Another problem we have are figureheads ueling these tensions. For example, the current President, Muhammadu Buhari, once said that \"the regions who didn't vote for him shouldn't expect the same treatment as those who voted for him\". He has a history of tribal and religious bigotry and those comments didn't help his image in the south east and south western parts of the country at all.Recently, the 4th most dangerous terrorist group in the world: \"The Fulani Herdsmen\" (although they are really just armed bandits and cattle rustlers and not actual herdsmen) have been running riot in several states in Nigeria. Killing hundreds of people, damaging property and destroying farms. The government has reacted poorly and many people feel that the president is holding back because these terrorists are \"his people\" (the President is also a Fulani man). So you can see.Nigerians are being vocal about wanting the President to be kicked out in the coming 2019 elections, but what fails to be seen is if these vocal people on social media actually represent the feelings of the average Nigerian especially those in rural areas.  In summary, the president is deeply unpopular now and complaints have ranged from his constant medical leaves to London, his supposed biogtry and nepotism when making appointments along with his sheer incompetence in leadership and economic policies.",

The Igbos usually agitate for a referendum and freedom to form their own country called Biafra. This is what led to the Nigerian Civil War and the agitation still continues till today although there is a feeling that most Igbos don't care about Biafra anymore and that it is just a vocal minority tearing things up.",

Joints are being burned in every corner where there is no law enforcement personnel. The strains here are so many that you could feel different with each visit to the same dealer. Lots of hybrid and impure weed are in the Cities, but the best can be found in very remote or rural areas where growing can be done discreetly. Nigerians have many fancy words for the good plant and the feeling derived from it. If you're in Nigeria and ever in need of a good blast, you could ask where to get some \"Gbana,\" \"Kpoli,\" \"Claro,\" or \"Igbo.\" The indica spp. is commonly refered to as \"SK\" and more expensive than the sativa.",

No trains - a colonial railway runs from the southern City of port Harcourt up north to Kano, Kaduna and Bornu. The traffic is usually congested in urban areas and potholes are a prevalent issue on Nigerian roads, which is the reason why the country has averaged more than 5,000 road accidents a year for the past 10 years. Nigerian drivers generally do not give a damn about traffic laws.",

Around that time the Christianisation of Poland began. The date marks a symbolic creation of Poland as a state that we know today but it existed before that time, it's just not possible to point out the exact year the country was created, as there's just not enough documents left from that time.",

If government can’t organize them better lifes, maybe someone can found any pro-educational and pro-good life organizations like “book club” or “intelligent club” or “young business teenagers club”. People need to organize themselves damn! Real scout organizations would be so good and helpful to be popular in Nigeria.",

                    "After doing some digging I have decided I am no longer a Christian. What is the best way to tell your parents?",
                    "Fam, some things are not by force. Lol.",
                    "In my experience, there’s no best way. It depends on the sort of parents you have and what their views on life are. You might need to be a little stern/make sure they know this is your decision and you’re sticking by it. There might be a lot of resistance to the idea for a few reasons, some that aren’t even related to religion. For instance it might be construed as disrespectful not to follow their guidance or something like that.",
                    "Again, depending on the sort of parents you have you might have to be prepared for some pretty hurtful things to be said in your direction. I’ve heard of friends who have had their mental faculties questioned after explaining that they’re no longer Christian/Muslim/What have you. There might be condescension and derision in their response.",
                    "There might also be genuine concern. Some of our parents genuinely and deeply believe this stuff and think somehow that your choice not to believe means that you won’t make heaven or some such and they might be genuinely afraid for you.",
                    "I honestly wouldn’t make a big deal of it unless it comes up. I had to eventually tell my parents honestly that none of that stuff works for me. They haven’t stopped trying to get my back and probably never will.",
                    "So yeah, the most important thing to take away from my random rant is that it depends very much on the kind of parents you have. Try not to come off as condescending or intellectually superior. Be sensitive to their concerns but be firm with your resolve. Explain calmly and cooly why you’ve chosen this path/why Christianity doesn’t work for you. You don’t have to give every reason. Share what your comfortable sharing.",
                    "Good luck.",

He'll win in the North East (except Adamawa, Taraba and maybe Gombe) surely as he is very popular there. Atiku may not be too strong in his state politically but if he gets the ticket and builds momentum, the tides may turn.North West may be very dicy. I don't see him winning Kaduna if his current unpopularity trend continues (and El Rufai isn't helping either). I feel votes will be split down the line in Sokoto and Zamfara. Kano and Katsina will definitely go to him. So the NW is a 50-50 region IMO, although he will get the outright majority due to potential landslide victories in Katsina and Kano.So now we know his opponent will get block votes from the SE and SS, while he'll have to settle for a majority in the NE and NW. This may put Buhari ahead because turnouts in the SE are usually low compared to massive numbers in the north (even if he shares votes) But... Rivers and Delta have about 3 million votes combined and if rigged to the maximum like last time, this may be damaging to his reelection bid.",

                    "Let me remind you that a short while ago former CIA officer 'Thomas' told us at parting that he is well aware of behind-the-scenes intrigues of the US intelligence in many countries of Africa. And he promised to come back to it.",
                    "https://s7.postimg.org/ex1dvdxe3/image.jpg",
                    "This time the interior of our meeting place was different. It was a comfortable and warm room with a view of a glorious seascape from the window. It was striking the eye that 'Thomas' came to the meeting dressed in casual style ... Just like last time, we habitually started with whisky and a cigar. After my vis-à-vis settled himself comfortably in the armchair and puffed aromatic smoke to the ceiling, he once again got to digging into his memories. While he was speaking, his recollections changed him right in front of my eyes. He became more energetic, his eyes were shining, even some of his wrinkles smoothed away. Once again, he felt like he is back in Langley. I need to mention that our talk was about quite another country and quite other people. Last time 'Thomas' told us about the work of the CIA in Liberia. This time, he began to talk about former Zaire, now its name is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But still, it was an exciting and absorbing story. Well, you may read it and decide for yourself.",
                    "In the latter half of the 90s of the last century, Zaire was among the turbulent regions of Africa where clashes between various powers and ethnic groups were running high. People from Rwanda, both the Tutsi and the Hutu, took refuge there. Direct participants of the genocide against the Tutsi were among them.",
                    "It was 'the moment of truth' for Washington. American puppet Mobutu was quickly losing power in Zaire. Mobutu had begun his upraising to power back in 1960 after a military coup and the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, Prime Minister of that country at that moment who got almost forgotten these days (while his name used to be widely known throughout the liberated Africa and the socialist-camp countries).",
                    "If we go even farther back in history, the USA had included the Congo (I'd rather call this country just the Congo to make it easier) in the sphere of own national interests almost right after achieving independency. It is important to note that Americans had special interest for the Congo due to his outstanding natural riches. The Congo's mineral wealth contained almost full spectrum of most needed resources like copper ore, coal, iron ore, gold and diamonds. And to cap it all, more than a half of the world's explored reserves of uranium were located there!!! Naturally, the USA was zealous for keeping a tight hold on the situation in the Congo if not directing it in a broad manner. So, President Mobutu took advantage of America's assistance and support in the military coup to seize the power.",
                    "Taking into account all mentioned factors, the CIA followed its standard practice and introduced its net of agents into the dictator's immediate environment. At the period of time we are talking about, special president's advisor Honore Ngbanda-Nzambo Ко Atumba was among America's confidential agents.",
                    "https://s7.postimg.org/yrnfhikbf/image.jpg",
                    "'Thomas' recalled that the CIA had entered into undercover relations with Ngbanda-Nzambo long before the described events and assisted in his career progression. The African had a chance to work in national intelligence, the diplomatic service, he even used to head the Ministry of Defense of that country. For over fifteen years he had been holding various positions in the immediate environment of the top persons of the state who would come and go. And he was a universal agent; he was perfect both as an information provider and as an influencer. He had vast contacts not only within Africa but also in France, Belgium, South Korea.",
                    "Here are a few facts that characterize Ngbanda-Nzambo. There was speculation about his dishonesty, love of 'easy' money, accounting frauds, smuggling, and even plain stealing of funds in his custody. At the post of the head of the Zairean intelligence he descended to embezzling the money that the CIA officially allocated for his department via partnership channels. However, that never forced American coordinators to give him up as the information he provided paid off many times over. When Ngbanda-Nzambo had to go for overseas trips on the direction of the 'boss' (that's how he liked to call Mobutu) he often took his wife along at the government's expense. So, she was able to see not only African landscapes but also scenic splendors of China, Korea and Singapore. In Langley they never begrudged the cost of Ngbanda-Nzambo's service. He regularly received bonuses (award fees) from the headquarters. On special occasions they even delivered him some good champagne that was very much to the liking of the agent and his wife.",
                    "In the end of Mobutu's reign, Ngbanda-Nzambo was giving Americans the full picture of the dictator's international contacts, his illegit funding sources as well as weapons supply chains to the region just before the First Congo War. During the most 'hectic' period, the agent was directly contacted even by Assistant Secretaries of State, among them was Susan Rice who was in charge of African Affairs. However, the situation got out of hand and after Kinshasa fell down Ngbanda-Nzambo was forced to go into exile...",
                    "Many years have passed since that moment and now 'Thomas' is retired from service. But the media reports that he is aware of the fact that Honore Ngbanda-Nzambo Ко Atumba is now at the head of the Congolese oppositionists in France who call themselves patriots. Taking into consideration that the CIA usually does not lose contacts with its agents of that rank, 'Thomas' leaves open the possibility of America's attempted revenge in the Congo. In this case, Langley may well make use of Ngbanda-Nzambo ... By the way, 'Thomas' is not only familiar with the CIA agents in the highest quarters of African countries. He also got to do some field work in Europe so he knows a lot about especially valuable agents among European top-ranking officials, in particular, the CIA informer in one of governmental structures in Germany.",
                    "But he will probably tell it later...",

And instead of turning this into a generation vs generation thing, you should offer some insight as to why most South Africans I've met hate her (look at the thread on r/SouthAfrica too, many people shitting on her) while we on the outside treat her like a hero.Mind you, this is not an \"MLK cheated on his wife and thesis\" attempt at spoiling a legacy, Winnie Mandela has done some shady and cruel things that should make her \"heroine\" status to questionable.",

Like I said, this is no way comparable to the shit white people bring up about MLK. Nor is it even close to Jerry Rawlings or Thomas Sankara even though they fought battles different from those of Winnie.A user, u/timoleo simply wanted to know why the comments on r/southafrica were like that and I showed him why. How come that somehow got to you lol? Just a little bit of insight into the life of someone who is regarded as a hero and because it had some stuff you weren't comfortable with, you got upset. You don't come across as a person who tolerates dissenting views, and for someone who claims to be older, you should do better than that.Your rabid response to a conversation that needed none of that whatsoever is laughable. You are desperate to ignore and cover up the brutal actions and rhetoric of someone who promoted violent mass murder and hate. People like you who think the world is all black and white and are ready to dismiss opinions (in this case, facts) because you come from a different generation just amaze me. If you have to turn this into a generational thing to make a point, then you aren't really smart at all.",

She also gave orders to kill another person which I believe was a part of a cover up to the previous case.She has shown to be ruthless, unforgiving and manipulative. So why pretend she is some flawless person when her tactics were at best questionable? What does anyone have to gain from that? You think we are suddenly going to forget Winnie was anti-apartheid and rightfully so because we are able to admit that she did some bad things?This is not about bowing down to opinions, this is about facing the truth and facing the facts. This is about how we need to stop looking at people who fucked up through rose colored glasses because they did a right thing. Winnie was no angel, no one is but she isn't exactly a role model for a progressive fight for rights either.This is not about being bloodless. This is about methods and intent.

                    "I do still think people have every right to be offended by that sort of statement. It's not polite using language like \"shithole\" but he didn't say it on stage to the whole world, he said it in a cabinet meeting behind closed doors and somehow word got out that he did it. Let's not forget Obama allegedly called Benjamin Netanyahu \"chicken shit\" in the same setting so going by the same logic, one could argue Obama is a \"Nazi\" but that is also too extreme of a statement. The truth is, neither is a positive thing to say, but I think what Trump was getting at is that these countries are unstable and have some bad cultural aspects but America, where I live, has some of that too. There are still good things we can take from these foreign cultures, but not all cultures are good. A lot of these countries still have things like terrorism, rape, gangs, child-rape, and human trafficking running amuck so with that in mind, I think it's safe to say that Trump was within reason to say what he said, he just could have chosen better words.",
                    "As for the Norway thing, again, with the context, he's just saying that cuz Norway is a more peaceful place so we don't have to worry about immigrants coming from there as much as from those other countries.",

Yes. But it isn't exclusively a vice limited to the practice of Islam. Children are sexually abused in all parts of Nigeria and the rates are quite alarming. Claiming that the molestation of young boys and girls occurs in only some parts of the country because of your own cultural and religious bias enables the continuous perpetration of these crimes right under your nose.Remember how Christians would shame Muslims for child marriages yet willfully ignored that boys were being abused by priests in churches on a global scale for decades?

The western world had centuries to work its way through all that, while you guys are doing it all at once in the space of a decades. And all of that while also dealing with the aftermath of colonialism and with all the pressure of the high-speed modern world.",

Think of the most civilzed person in the world, put this person in a situation where it has to struggle for anything and this person becomes something similar to an animal, disregarding any rules of civil and normal behavior, the person starts to kill, rape, rob and whatnot. Besides of that this whole debate is to put certain people in a certain position, like, that they have to fulfill certain requirements, that it's the other ones who are making the rules and \"testing\" them for being worthy of participating in something and that if something goes wrong it's definitely their own fault because it simply looks like those people are the bad ones who have to acommodate absolute of any context.",

Many people believed playing the dumb everyman was an act that would end the day that he was elected. Sadly, they were wrong. I hate that this corrupt idiot was elected.

She also fails to note that African American women and African women face entirely different challenges.She uses racism to link both demographics and rightly so, but forgets to mention that both sides are culturally distinct and her all-encompassing solution of womanism cannot work at all and will eventually lead to factions like it did with Feminism.Her weak and pretty vague examples meant to showcase how \"strong and independent\" African women have been throughout history are also quite laughable because it attempts to downplay the massive challenges women in Africa face in the form of suppression and oppression both within the family and outside it.She comes across as someone so deeply entrenched in her own internalized misogyny that she is desperate to discredit the original idea of feminism by promoting this so-called \"womanism\". From what I have read about this womanism so far from the author, it doesn't seem like an ideology that stands or fights for anything but rather another version of Feminism Lite like Chimamanda would put it.",

                    "Sexual assault occurs in all cultures, but only in Islam does it have divine sanction. The Qur’an teaches that Infidel women can be lawfully taken for sexual use (cf. its allowance for a man to take “captives of the right hand,” 4:3, 4:24, 23:1-6, 33:50, 70:30). Liya Sharibu refused to convert to Islam, and so she was held, while the jihadis released the Muslim girls they had kidnapped.",

                    "This is the kind of stupidity that irritates me. There are over 40 million Muslims in Nigeria yet you are quick to condemn all of them over the actions of around 3000 militants at most. That aboki doing your shoe could kill you, but he didn't. That aboki fitting your clothes could kill you, but he didn't. That aboki making your suya could have kill you long agoooo , but he didn't. But the moment a terrorist attack that was targeting Muslims accidentally touches a Christian girl, your stupidity comes out in full force. It doesn't come out when militants in the Niger Delta were killing shell employees. It doesn't come out when stupid young Igbo boys started trying to start another civil war. It doesn't come out when pastors are regularly caught in fraud and scandal.",
                    "PEOPLE DIED. Do you think the parents of the girls that died are celebrating? When they are Muslims too? You are too young to be thinking like this, this line of thinking is meant for old people that are dying soon.  You can't be expecting to cause change when you hate 1/3rd the Nigerian population. What are you going to do? Are you going to invade the north and kill all the Muslims? The Muslims that make up 60% of our army? Who will support your genocide? You better start thinking like a human being my friend, before you go and do something stupid",
                    "Damn, 12 bricks. That comment is not stupid. It is the simple truth. The quran, just like the Bible, is a really old document written by a dude that says he received revelations from an angel like 800 years ago. Some of the things written in there should not be used as any law to govern any nation or group of people in the 21st century. What Boko Haram is trying to do is create an islamic caliphate similar to 13th century Arabia whem Mohammed was around. In the 21st century? That doesn't make sense.",
                    "The argument that the \"aboki making my suya did not kill me\" does not mean people should not be angry when the aboki cousin is killing people in the Northeast. I detest the notion that citizens who have not been molested or massacred by Hausa-Fulani in their locales should somehow be grateful for it. That's just BS. Nigeria is a nation of laws. If you someone wrongs you, you report them to the authorities. Killing a fellow human being because they offend you should never be the norm, or even an exception for that matter, in a nation with laws. These guys act like we still live in the 17th century or something. Seriously, where in the world do you hear of a group having the notion that they have the mandate to exact revenge upon anyone who offends them, and everything will be just nice and dandy? Are they mad? So please, drop that argument. It's ridiculous at best",
                    "Yes, there are 40 million muslims, but that does not change the fact that these terrorists are virtually 100% muslim, or that they claim to take their guiding principles from the same Holy book that the non-violent 40 million muslims use. So YES, it does matter that they are muslims, and they should be condemned by fellow muslims and other Northern Nigerians.",
                    "What do you mean by \"accidentally\", if I may ask? I need you to explain your reasoning because it seems to me that this Christian girl was kidnapped with a group of 105 other girls but somehow she was the only one that was singled out because of her religious affinity. A girl of less than 18 years? Why? Why don't they just let her go with the others? What is so offensive to them in this young, impressionable girl that they can not see fit to let her go? If not that this barbaric idiots don't have anything better to do than to oppress and terrorize innocent, hapless citizens in the name of a religion. They are just senseless, animalistic miscreants who have been enabled by an irresponsible federal gov't. Yet here you are, and it almost seems as if you are trying to justify their actions.",
                    "The young Igbo boys you speak of. Did they kill anybody? Did they even carry weapons? All they did was agitate for a right to a referendum to create a breakaway state, and the FG was quick to brand them as a terrorist organization. I do not support Kanu or the Idea of a breakaway state, but to somehow equate IPOB with boko haram is the height of irresponsibility.",

                    "Even though I am sure you don't mean it, you have stated the truth right here. Northern Nigeria is in control of Nigeria, and that is why any military action won't work unless they support it. Which they won't. That's why they were quick to send army to Kanu's house but nothing has been done to stop the rampaging of the herdsmen slaughtering innocent Nigerians. That is why the various reports that there are people within the ruling class that are sponsoring these guys, and yet nothing is done to arrest or expose them. It is true that the Military is mostly northern. That definitely has to change tbh. There are individuals withing Nigerian who have immense power and influence that we don't know. They say what goes and what doesn't. I can bet a finger that 80% of that group of people is made of Northerners. This is not conspiracy theory, it is fact. Nigeria is a wholly corrupt nation, and that is why I don't really blame boko haram, or the herdsmen, or even people like you.

During the Biafra war Ojukwu took Soviet money to destabilize Nigeria, a move that would undermine the British diplomacy, he started a war that killed millions of people for money, no Nigerian politician has done something as evil as this. Then when shell came and invested heavily in the south south, you cousins decided to start kidnapping the white men just to make a little side Money. When the government retaliated without mercy, everyone started saying they went too far. 80% of all the gangs in Nigeria are Igbo boys. The Igbo land self is useless, very little oil and almost no farm land because Igbo men want to give birth to the whole world. It is that type of land you want to take and use to make a country? Cameroon has just been timing you, the moment you declare independence they will take the country away like biscuit. Biafra can't join ECOWAS because Nigeria made it, Biafra has no army because the Hausa control it. Biafra has no grain because the north grows it.

During the Biafra war Ojukwu took Soviet money to destabilize Nigeria, a move that would undermine the British diplomacy, he started a war that killed millions of people for money, no Nigerian politician has done something as evil as this. Then when shell came and invested heavily in the south south, you cousins decided to start kidnapping the white men just to make a little side Money. When the government retaliated without mercy, everyone started saying they went too far. 80% of all the gangs in Nigeria are Igbo boys. The Igbo land self is useless, very little oil and almost no farm land because Igbo men want to give birth to the whole world. It is that type of land you want to take and use to make a country? Cameroon has just been timing you, the moment you declare independence they will take the country away like biscuit. Biafra can't join ECOWAS because Nigeria made it, Biafra has no army because the Hausa control it. Biafra has no grain because the north grows it. Just like you starved the first time, you will starve again.",

Doesn't really work though because unlike the US, the electorate is not really good at holding their reps accountable. Everyone is focused on the executive.

There is no state gov since it's not an actual state. Many of its indigenous residents have tried to call for recognition and statehood but it hasn't worked out. It's a bit of an elite territory where members of the NASS and the executive live while in office. Many elites from other parts of the country will also try to go there to invest in real estate.",

                    "It is the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) 1999 (as amended) (CFRN 1999) that governs the administration of the FCT, Abuja. As the name implies, the FCT is not a state but the Federal Capital Territory of the nation.",
                    "The executive structure of the FCT is different from the structures in the states. A case in point is the head of the executive arm of government in the FCT. There's no position of a governor of the FCT as the 36 states have. Instead, the FCT is administered by the President of the FRN. He usually does this by appointing a Minister of the FCT, who he can fire at will.",
                    "For the legislative structure of the FCT, the FCT is made up of six local councils  known as Area Councils (AC) (as oppose to local government areas in the States) comprising the City of Abuja and 5 ACs, namely: Abaji, Abuja Municipal, Gwagwalada, Kuje, Bwari and Kwali. These ACs have it's own elective positions in the executive and legislative arm of the councils. The head of the executive arm in the ACs is known as a councillor. The ACs' legislative arm makes bye laws, usually matters in the residual legislative list (see CFRN 1999) to govern the AC in question. The ACs also have just one elective representative at the national legislative house, i.e. the upper legislative chamber know as the Senate (1 rep) and 2 representatives at the lower legislative chamber known as House of Representatives.",

                    "This article is written to pull on the heart strings of foreigners. It ignores most of the context of the Nigerian society in exchange for selective facts that make the Nigerian middle class look worse than it is. The writer doesn't mention how the majority of these \"slaves\" are being sent out by their parents to get educations, education that would almost be impossible to come by in the far poorer areas of the country. While this is a terrible system no child should ideally go through, the alternatives (starvation, illiteracy, disease and death) are much less appealing.",
                    "People are different, some people are outright evil. And the conditions the writer described are very similar to the central plot of many Nollywood movies. This means that it is common sense not to treat a house help like that. To put it in perspective, it's the same cultural trope as bullies giving wedgies in American films.",
                    "The HIV testing is weird, it seems very forced. It is based on how paranoid the family is. HIV is a very common disease in Nigeria, the stigma around it is strong and there is very little to no medical support for it. I was frequently tested for Ebola when I was traveling for school, it wasn't something I could or could not consent to. The alternative would be for me to go back home I'd I refused testing.",
                    "While I don't support beatings, it is part of Nigerian culture for now. I am 70% sure that person also beats their children. It is losing popularity and eventually it will become archaic.",
                    "The bottom line is that the mistreated house help trope is being played up as an original angle by this writer. It should be a symbiotic relationship, not a parasitic one. The alternative is far worse as most of these households can easily survive without the use of house helps but in the current world education is compulsory for a basic life. If all househelps are getting an education, 10% of them being mistreated is an acceptable margin as the education they get far outweighs the horrible life they would live without it.",
                    "I feel horrible reading this where you just basically justified child abuse and slavery.",

                    "Your problem with the article seems to be that it paints Nigeria and its citizens black and not whether or not there is some truth to it?",
                    "The writer doesn't mention how the majority of these \"slaves\" are being sent out by their parents to get educations, education that would almost be impossible to come by in the far poorer areas of the country.",
                    "You put slaves in quote, as if giving someone an education in return for maltreatment and subjection to hard labour automatically does not make them victims of slavery. Slavery is slavery.",
                    "If all househelps are getting an education, 10% of them being mistreated is an acceptable margin as the education they get far outweighs the horrible life they would live without it.",
                    "This is just awful. There is nothing acceptable about the maltreatment of children and young adults. Something that is destined to leave psychological scars and spark a cycle of endless abuse down generations is not something we should tolerate or even debate AT ALL. And to claim that the number is as low as 10% wow. I am curious, do you live in Nigeria? How long have you lived there? Because I doubt anyone who has had an extensive stay in this country and has some insight into the way families are run would say such a thing. A good number of the children in question are prone to abuse because they are soft targets on which to pour their frustration on. Societal pressure regarding many things, stress in the work place, depression, dealing with a failed marriage, even dealing with Lagos traffic alone are some of the many things work against the average Nigerian household and its members. And you know what, these children are the ones who bear the full brunt of the frustration-fueled abuse which takes on many forms.",
                    "Looking back at our society, we can see what decades of institutionalized misogyny, abuse of human rights, blatant disregard for the law and worshipping of mediocrity has done to us. We have a society filled with child brides, crime, slavery, trafficking and widespread suppression of women. We have these problems, they are massive and we should not water down their prevalence or act as if they do not exist.",
                    "Do you have a point? Yes you do, and it would be foolish to say otherwise. But your approach is downright shocking. There is absolutely no hint of empathy for the victims and you in no way attempted to outrightly condemn what is obviously a plague in Nigeria today. Instead, you are trying to excuse the people who perpetrate this vice while making it seem like they are doing these victims - and society - a favour. This is not purely a case of alternatives or picking a lesser evil like you make it sound. This is just a case of a failed system and how we desperately need to be better. Just because a horrible situation could be worse DOES NOT MAKE IT OKAY.And any abuser of children in the name of keeping a househelp reading your comment today would have their rotten behaviour enabled. We should not in anyway make these people feel like they are doing the right thing.",
                    "I am disappointed in this comment and I truly hope we as a people learn to do better for our children rather than making it seem like it is okay for them to settle for far less. Nobody should be abused, maltreated and overworked just because they want an education.",
                    "I sound like that because while the author takes time to point out the problem, he offers no solutions at all. Zero solutions. Not a single piece of advice or a charity that is doing something. I can write hundreds of pages about how people in first world countries are more likely to suffer from diseases like cancer. If I offer no solution, by simply looking at my work, it would seem like I am implying that the best way to avoid cancer is to avoid the first world. And if someone attacks me, like they should, stating that the high amount of reported cancer cases is due to better medical technology, would you attack them saying that cancer is bad and they should think about all the kids dying from it?",
                    "The child labor situation is terrible. But it will slowly phase out with urbanization, every single country in the world was in a similar situation. The increase in education will lead to urbanization, and the urbanization will end many social injustices. Education is far more valuable than human rights. This would be a different story if it was a 100% of them being abused, but I am certain that the number is under 10%",

It's a piece on the prevalence of cancer, not on how to tackle it. And if you take a neutral stance, I'm pretty sure no one will have the impression that you are telling people to avoid these countries.",
                    "And if someone attacks me, like they should, stating that the high amount of reported cancer cases is due to better medical technology, would you attack them saying that cancer is bad and they should think about all the kids dying from it?",
                    "Once again, not a really solid analogy. My point is that the author is on to something, and we should not ignore it or act like the perpetrators are angels.",
                    "The child labor situation is terrible. But it will slowly phase out with urbanization, every single country in the world was in a similar situation. The increase in education will lead to urbanization, and the urbanization will end many social injustices.",
                    "To be fair, it doesn't work this way. You need to take active measures to curb situations like these. Leaving it to urbanization and people eventually getting \"woke\" will not help. Employment of child labor at home has become a cultural thing, just like hawking and marrying off underaged girls. There is a limit to how influential urbanization can be on a popular and embraced aspect of culture. Are you not aware that the figures of child brides and out of school children are much worse than they were 30 years ago?Also, take a look at some countries in the Middle East for example, the \"urbanization\" did absolutely nothing for women until countries like Saudi started taking active steps towards alleviating the enigma of female suppression.Another point you should consider is that Nigeria's population is on a meteoric rise and I doubt that with the many issues that it is destined to bring along, people will give a fuck about child labor. Let's face it, Nigerians have never given a hoot about the rights of children and no amount of education will change that. At least not education in the sense that you mean. Sending a child to school will not tweak the moral compass and judgment of said child. The person a child becomes, their character etc all rely on what they learn at home and what they see people in society do.Things like misogyny and tribalism are not learned in schools and will not be unlearned through the education in these schools. Especially not schools that have been compromised into normalising things like female subservience (I mean, did you read those sexist Social Studies and Home Economics textbooks back in school?). Sure, education helps, but we need to look at the bigger picture.To tackle issues like these, a systematic approach through the enforcement of laws, community programs to raise awareness and empowering of institutions that cater for the wellbeing of children is necessary. It needs to be holistic. If you just rely on the education that these abused children are getting to improve society, while neglecting important factors like their perception of certain cultural norms, laws and human rights, it just isn't going to work.Ask yourself: What impact is going to school and getting a normal education going to have on a child labor victim when he/she has been groomed into thinking their messed up upbringing was normal? ...especially when people like you keep saying that it is not only normal, but encouraged and benefits society?",
                    "Education is far more valuable than human rights",
                    "This is sickening but I will not be angered. So, essentially, you think things like freedom of expression, the right to live etc are less valuable than education?I'm curious, do you keep a child at home for manual labor? And are you desperately trying to make yourself believe that it is justified? Because your comments are becoming very disturbing.To say that you'd rather pick education over basic human rights is appalling, psychopathic and tyrannical. You do not even want to entertain the thought that both things are possible and can exist side by side since you seem to be obsessed with your belief that employing child labour and paying with education is some kind of virtue.",

I am sure you would rather the British had not abused those men over the very pivotal step independence was. Currently there is no political platform to seize power with, no matter what you do or say the lack of education will cut you of from more than 70% of the voting population. This is why the only difference between the political parties is tribal alliance. They all have the same policy and ideas Repeated over and over again.

We can do better.For an adult like you to sit here and defend child labor is very shameful.

                    "A very interesting conversation here. Truly rare on r/Nigeria. I have to say that I agree with most viewpoints on this thread. But if I had to pick sides (which I know isn't really the point here), I would have to go with 12 bricks for a couple of reasons.",
                    "The institution of indentured servitude (a term I prefer to slavery in this context) in Nigeria is not new. It's been around since pre-transatlantic slavery times. Rich families \"owned\" slaves that they acquired either by conquest or purchase. These \"slaves\" often lived good lives and would go on to attain some level of power and respectability in the households they served. Many of them will marry- taking spouses from other slaves in said households. Evolution has clearly taken place over time and many negative aspects of that institution have held over till now, sadly.",
                    "To use the term \"slavery\" is just a bit too harsh in many cases, and I'll explain. Many of these people are not forcefully taken, or stolen. In fact, several of them are more like contract staff in that they often have an agent, or a handler if you will who tends to many aspects of their \"professional\" well being. This agent will check in on them from time to time, make sure they are doing ok, and may even take them away should better financial opportunities present themselves. Many of them get clothes, an education (not at the same level as their master's kids), and this in addition to getting some sort of a salary. I know of families who have taken servants in and kept them for longer than they are needed just so they can provide them with some sort of lasting benefits outside of money made. This has been my experience for the most part, and I know there can be many truly horrible ones out there. The suggestion that it is all doom and gloom is not accurate, for the most part. The article is not very nuanced on the issue as is the case with many articles of this nature. It seems to be geared towards inciting a specific emotional response. I do not even think that a comparison to the slavey in Libya is necessary.",
                    "Nigeria, and Africa as a whole needs home-grown solutions to its problems. We can't continue to advocate western prescriptions to many of our most basic institutional problems because they rarely every work. It works in the west because it has been tested over many centuries and found to work. Plus context is very different. I agree that this is a problem (though not as bad as painted) but we can't continue to use the same labeling conventions that first world countries use. \"Slavery\", \"child abuse\", Child labor\".... all these labeling and castigating does nothing. Also, while I agree that moral uprightness should be a standard and should not be taken for granted, I am not a believer in moral absolutism. The idea that what is right is right no matter what, and what is wrong is wrong no matter what. NO!. Context is very important. 1st world countries have strong institutions, and very high relative literacy levels. The kind of sociocultural issues they deal with are of a different dimension than ours. We can't compare our problems together, and so we have to be cautious when we try to compare solutions.",
                    "Lastly, societies do evolve. The Europe and America of today is not the same as from 100 or 200 years ago. It used to be ok to treat people as chattel. There was a time in the so-called developed world that women could not vote. As crazy as it sounds, interracial marriage used to taboo in many parts of the world. There are many things we consider to be ok now that will not be ok 50 years from now. Nigeria too is evolving, and soon, this too shall pass. What we must try to do is to find ways to accelerate that evolution... without breaking the system. It is not ok to say indentured servitude or owning househelp is wrong, so therefore we must break the institution. That is the wrong way to go about it. Instead, we must focus our energies on eliminating incentives for such practices to take place in the first place. Family planning, high-quality public school education, prioritization of the girl-child education are some long term lasting solutions. When you come to think of it, nobody wants to send their own child to someone else's house to become a servant. Na condition wey make crayfish bend. Let us change the conditions. Thank you!",

They are very cheap and common around here.Locally, in my part of the country, everyone calls them \"aya\". There's a drink made from these nuts called \"kunu-aya\" which is quite tasty and refreshing. This drink is usually sold in plastic bottles by street vendors and hawkers.BTW, what took you to a West African grocer? And what else did you buy?",

                    "I'm an African American that grew up in South Florida and I recently came across the song Come Closer by the Nigerian artist Wizkid. I originally thought it was a dancehall track until I looked up the artist and I saw that he was Nigerian. There is a large Caribbean so dance hall was something that I'd hear on the radio ever since I was really young. I was shocked by how similar Afrobeats music  from West Africa is to what you'd hear in the islands everything from the rhythms to dialects and how they rhyme are very similar.",
                    "Is this typical of Western Africa?",
                    "The term \"Afrobeats\" is a misnomer. Someone in the UK heard it somewhere, thought it sounded good and decided to run with it. Afrobeat is a separate genre of Nigerian music that is a fusion of Nigerian-Ghanian highlife and funk, pioneered by the late legendary Nigerian act Fela Kuti. You may have heard of him. If you haven't, please look him up. You will like what you see.",
                    "What Wizkid typically does is hip-pop. A more appropriate term may be afro-pop. Other Nigerian artists in that category include Davido, Techno, RunTown. The answer to your question is no. Nigerian artists don't sound anywhere close to that naturally. You're right in that it is a carribean sound with carribean language. The album for that song is actually called sounds from the other side. Wizkid is really just trying out other concepts in pop music to try to expand his popularity and fan base. That's all."

                    "I thought it was a fantastic movie with a brilliant concept. As a Nigerian, I felt it portrayed some aspects of African life well, and other parts were hit and miss. But I would like to know what others thought.",
                    "I was blown away. The experience was greatly enhanced by watching it in a cinema full of Nigerians. Sold out showing.",
                    "I’m still negotiating with sleep so I’ll probably come back with more intelligent thoughts later but overall, I’m really glad that film was made. It soothed my soul.",
                    "Remember, No Spoilers when you come back from sleep.",
                    "That movie was good. Everyone praised the main guy, and all the supporting cast, especially the antagonist. The plot was also really good.",
                    "But here's my thing with the movie. I just can't shake the feeling that it was made for people who don't really know Africa. It was another Marvel superhero movie with a good guy, a bad guy fighting. Wakanda is supposed to represent an African nation that is super wealthy, successful, and technologically advanced. This is nice because it makes you feel proud as an African/black person. You finally feel like the rest of the world will get to see Africa in such a positive and powerful light, and children will finally get to see a superhero in their own color... Except, it is not real. It's all fiction. Everything we see comes from the imagination of a comic book illustrator from 60 years ago. And I get it. Everyone knows it's not real. There is No one who has ever thought this was real. It is supposed to be entertainment, and that is the point. But you see, how I wish there was truly an African nation that was as wealthy or had similar technological advancement. I wish the fiction wasn't all fiction.",
                    "Many Africans suffer at the hands of tyrannical dictators. Children still suffer hunger and disease. Tribal and religious conflicts continue to divide and decimate us.",
                    "I wish the idea of Wakanda wasn't just one fictional country, but the true representation of the whole of Black Africa.",
                    "It will take a really long time to have an actual Wakanda in Africa. Nigeria and Congo should have been the Wakandas but decades of corruption and incompetence along with colonial meddling and slow scientific advancement on the continent means these immensely rich nations only ended up with the short end of the stick.But I do hope we see the likes of South Africa, Botswana, Gabon and Angola reach elite status soon enough.",
                    "Ghana seems on the come up. Accra is beautiful. Hope complimenting Ghana won't get me banned lol.",
                    "Prove it",
                    "Prove what?",
                    "That Ghana is on the up and up",
                    "Love your take. My only point of objection is the weird relationship I have with ethnic pride. That you’re supposed to be proud of something you did not choose is something i’ll never understand. It just come across as yet another form of virtue signaling",
                    "Lol, there are several things we did not choose, including the fact that you were born, or the family you are born to, or the fact that you have an education or that you are healthy. But yet, here we all are.",
                    "Not Nigerian, but the widespread use of Nsibidi was fascinating, cool writing system that no one seems to have heard of outside of Southeastern Nigeria.",
                    "Unfortunately, it came at a time when I can't really afford to go. Guess I will be waiting for the DVD release",
                    "Me too. In a place with no cinema at the moment. Will have to wait 2 months at least to see it",
                    "As a Nigerian living in the United States, I throughly enjoyed this film. Sure, it had its flaws but in a superhero film industry oversaturated by white, Adonis-esque men filling these roles; however, it felt nice to finally be represented on a stage of this magnitude - not only as a black man, but as an African as well.",

                    "Can you expand?",
                    "Kind of straightforward. Thor, Wolverine, Captain America, Hulk, Spider-Man...the genre is full of ripped white dudes.",
                    "When they mentioned Nigeria I was so happy.",
                    "Technically, that's a spoiler. But since we are Nigerians, yeah... that was bam. Marvel must really like Nigeria. They showed Lagos in the other movie too.",
                    "They didn’t show lagos, they only depicted Lagos . I will wait for the free version of the Black panther movie cos it’s a well orchestrated PR blitz that is giving it the present hype!!!",
                    "ehn, you didn't see that see that conductor shouting \"hold your 500 naira shange oo, Ojodu bagga!!, ojodu bagga bagga!\". or the lady selling 50 50 naira 'bonce'.",
                    "I am not sure we are talking about the same movie",
                    "You go gree pay 500 to oshodi from berger for molue",
                    "SPOILER..",
                    "Meh, didn't live up to the hype. I hope infinity war will be better. What is this doing in r/Nigeria anyways?",
                    "Many Nigerians are damn hyped for the movie that's why.",
                    "How I wish Africa can develop preserving its ancient cultures and traditions like in wakanda. Preserve the traditional markets, the Calabash, the talking drums, the market squares, the religions and many more stuff like that, all as part of the city life and being tech advanced. These days I weep for Africa when I see leaders destroying old traditions and trying to style or cities like Western cities.",
                    "We should stop trying to be western.Japan is advanced without being western",
                    "Exactly",

                    "Although,",
                    "Other than the clothes and some other stuff, it has NOTHING to do with Africa.",
                    "Wakanda is literally the opposite of every African country.",
                    "They didn't even show any food. Smh",
                    "Idk why people are going crazy over it as it showed culutral appreciation towards Africa, it barely did. The ones that were there were cool though.",
                    "But there is no reason to hype is as some step for black people and Africans.",
                    "I will wait and download it. And I don't want to raise my expectations so I don't get disappointed when I wqtch it",
                    "[removed]",
                    "Haven't seen the movie, but per colonialism I'd say I'm in two minds about that. My dilemma is because we will never know if we'd have progressed as a continent farther than we have now if we hadn't been colonised. We had our own societies and we would have caught up with the rest of the world at our own pace. The question is, how long would it have taken, though? This question is relevant because there was a tribe, the Koma people, somewhere in northern Nigeria who had no concept of clothes as at the late 1990s to early 2000s till missionaries found them. Obviously, the major Nigerian tribes were far ahead of the Koma people because of exposure to other/foreign cultures so it will remain a guess till there's some rigourous study done on this.",
                    "On the other hand, colonialism really bastardised African culture and identity something we are only beginning to reinvent. We have tried oyibo ways and we keep falling short of the goal. I feel we should have got the spirit of their principles but applied our own African methodologies to achieving the same goals, for example, the Lagos state government is currently working on a policy to translate educational material and teach in Yoruba language which I've long been an advocate for. I've met some intelligent people whose only disadvantage was their inability to speak English.",
                    "Didn't mean to rant but I hope you get the gist. Besides, colonialism has always existed across time and the history of the world. We should be thanking the white man for ending and criminalising it.",
                    "saw it with a friend when it first came out and a couple of days ago i took my mum to go and see it. she tends to fall asleep at the cinema bc some movies are quite dull to her, but not this time. she loved it and was raving about it on the drive home. keeps going on about how she’ll buy the dvd because the rest of the family has to see it too, aha",
                    "Did anyone notice the name Okoye was used? I also saw it in 3d, it did not disappoint."

My dilemma is because we will never know if we'd have progressed as a continent farther than we have now if we hadn't been colonised. We had our own societies and we would have caught up with the rest of the world at our own pace. The question is, how long would it have taken, though? This question is relevant because there was a tribe, the Koma people, somewhere in northern Nigeria who had no concept of clothes as at the late 1990s to early 2000s till missionaries found them. Obviously, the major Nigerian tribes were far ahead of the Koma people because of exposure to other/foreign cultures so it will remain a guess till there's some rigourous study done on this.",

                    "Hey r/Nigeria, I was wondering if anyone could give me specific models of some of the most common \"dumb\" phones used in Nigeria. I know that smart phones are increasing in popularity with brands like Tecno but I'm doing some research about older cellphones in Africa and I was hoping maybe someone here can help me with more information. I'm trying to understand what are the most common phones used in remote villages and people outside cities.",
                    "If you know of any studies or research online that would be even better, but just common brand names or specific models would be very helpful.",
                    "Thanks!",
                    "There aren't many older cellphone models here. But many Nigerians use low-end products from the likes of Nokia, Tecno, Injoo, Fero, Infinix, HTC, Huawei, Itel and many more. The likes of Sony Ericsson, Motorola, Sagem, Bird etc used to be very popular 10-15 years ago but not anymore. Not sure if those companies even make phones anymore.",
                    "Thanks a lot for the response! I will look into those brands. Also what do most of the basic phones have? Do they have a 3.5mm connector for headphones? Bluetooth audio? Also do you know of any other forums that I could ask about this?",
                    "3.5mm, yes. Bluetooth, yes for most. You could make an account on nairaland.com and ask. .😀",

                    "Unlike the West, we tend to dress uniquely wherever we are, so an Igbo person in the North is more likely to dress differently from a local Hausa person. Kinda like how Scottish traditional dress is different from British fashion which  is slightly different from American fashion.",
                    "There are cultural mannerisms and language, the same way American and British accents defer. Or how you can recognize an Eastern European or Japanese person speaking English. But when they can't tell through that means, they employ shiboleths to figure out who knows a piece of Hausa tradition or history, such that even if you grew up in the North, you won't know because they are so specific to ones religious and cultural identities.",

If you're familiar with the accents, then you know someone from Liverpool from someone who grew up in Hastings or whatever. Likewise, you can hear the difference between a southern American and any other American... Everywhere you go, there are slight differences in look, mannerism, and speech that give away identity, and sometimes they're used against us.

I also understand many Fulani have chosen to settle down and adapt to more sedentary lifestyles like most other Nigerians, and that the pastoralists among them are now a minority. What I am curious about is the other aspects of their way of life that differentitates those in Nigerian from others. What guiding principles do they go by?"

                    "Hello everyone! I have a few questions about living costs and food/utilities, etc. how much will it cost roughly for a single guy. And is it different from town to town? Also, about getting job offers, I’m a dentist and I’m collecting the info and the requirements in order to get my license to practice dentistry in Nigeria so if there is any fellow dentist here it would be great! But I’m asking about how to get a job offer while I’m outside Nigeria. Which websites you use while job hunting? Or should I wait until I get there and search directly? And which town you can suggest that can be more suitable for me? I’m a dentist as I said above, also I’m a mobile photographer and a filmmaker. I love quite places with lots of open areas and beaches if there is any and lots of options to go out and hike, swim or do sports. Would love to hear your answers and any advice will be much appreciated! Thanks in advance. : )",
                    "Hi, I have just enquired from my contacts in Nigeria on your behalf. You will need to register with the Nigerian Medical and Dental Council if you were not trained in Nigeria, before you can seek employment. In addition they suggest you make a trip and visit Nigeria first before ever making the move to relocate. Start by visiting a major hospital at Abuja or Lagos. There you will meet professional colleagues who can advise you further.",

I knew about the registration with the Nigerian Medical and Dental Council as I got my dental degree from another country plus I need to pass an assessment exam.

You got all services you're used to in Europe or US. Can't remember the rates but I felt Uber Taxi fares were fair, less expensive than the Transport Services offered by the Hotels. Meals in the Hotels were 5000-6500 Naira. You could eat cheaper outside but Hygiene and safety issues were my concern. I used up 13000 Naira for Mobile telephony and Internet Access outside the Hotels. I briefly went Shopping at their most popular Mall, Shoprite. Prices there are similar to Prices in Europe. I hope this gives you an idea what the cost of living is.",
