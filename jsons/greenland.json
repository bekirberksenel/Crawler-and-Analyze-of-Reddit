                    "I recently found out through a DNA ancestry test that I am 39% native american from Greenland (the rest is mostly southern European). I have many questions, but most importantly I don't know what to think or feel. I would like to learn more and somehow become involved in some form of Greenlandic culture. Is that weird? I want to learn more about Greenland and its people. I would love to make some friends or atleast meet someone from Greenland to exchange knowledge. I know 39% might not sound like a lot. But it's a huge chunk of my DNA that I never knew existed and I'd just like to learn more.",

So to me, it would make no difference if I found out I were 39% Greenlander. I wouldn't be 39% Greenlander, but 39% of my DNA'd stem from a group of people that lived in Greenland so many hundred of years ago and with whom you share nothing except a few strings of tissue.

What are some recommended tours and locations to visit? Trusted tour agency info is also appreciated. Thanks for any help you can offer.",

If you'd be up to be a protagonist in the film: that's amazing too! Just message me privately. I can share some credentials/further infos with you then.It would be amazing to hear from some of you.

I forbindelse med mit studie er jeg dog n√∏dt til at bruge noget af fritiden deroppe p√• at blive bedre til at programmere, da jeg g√•r glip af en del undervisning. Jeg s√∏ger derfor en makker der vil n√∏rde sammen med mig. Det er ikke s√• vigtigt om du har kodet en masse i forvejen, eller lige er begyndt og blot √∏nsker at l√¶re mere. Det ville bare v√¶re fedt med √©n at sparre med, og s√• g√∏r det jo heller ikke noget hvis det rent faktisk byder p√• en mulighed for at m√∏de nogle nye mennesker, frem for at sidde alene og stirre ind i sk√¶rmen hele dagen.",

                    "If you, seasoned Greenlanders, had one week to spend in Greenland, where would you go and why? Is there public transport of any kind, or should I rent a car? I'm happy to couchsurf, camp, hostel...whatever is the best way to see the country. I'm just fascinated by cultures in the extreme north--I went to Iceland last year and loved it. I'd like to go on some hikes, really delve into the natural environment. I'd like to hang out at a bar and try weird food and alcohols.

                    "Edit: wow wow wow, I just learned that there aren't roads between towns. That's amazing! I definitely want to walk, I come from aback-packing family. Also would be happy on a boat. What great possibilities.",

I don't see any information on the museum websites, is it something you just call and inquire about?",
                    "Look into South Greenland. You can't really drive cars there easily, but there are several gravel roads/trails that you could hike or drive an ATV on - these link several small villages and sheep farms. This would also allow you to see viking ruins and such. The main towns around there would be Qassiarsuk and Igaliku.

(I love languages, I'm learning Hungarian at the moment.)",
                    "The tourist ferries I think would be a good starting point, but I prefer to \"slow travel,\" arriving in a place and spending a few days there, if not a couple weeks. I want to see the undersides of leaves, not just the view of the forest, if you get what I mean. I want to see the same place for a few days, see how it changes and how the people interact. Then expanding out, going down the trails people point out to me, taking a boat to the next city, or walking there.",
                    "I am interested in Nuuk, for reasons you've said. I mentioned the museum bit--I am a heavy history buff and I've done some reading on the settlement of Greenland and Iceland in the past. It would be incredible to see some of that stuff first-hand.",
                    "I don't have a lot of money, but I'm willing to save for the things that interest me. So assume I'll cover airfare, and then be operating on a low but comfortable budget. Is couchsurfing a thing in Greenland? I couchsurfed across Europe and in Iceland, I'm also down to just sleep in a tent somewhere pretty. What's the rules on wild camping Greenland?",

                    "Transport is the most expensive part of Greenland. There are no roads at all so hitch hiking is impossible. Between towns there are planes, few helicopters and sometimes ferries (AUL.gl, Diskoline), that's it. Sometimes it is possible to get a boat ride by locals, but don't count on it for long-distance travel.",
                    "Diskoline is actually also the ferry that locals use, even though their website may give the impression that it is a tourist business. It is the only ferry operator in Disko bay and South Greenland (i.e. the Qaqortoq area).",
                    "I wanted to say that Kalaallisut is prohibitively difficult, but then Hungarian also is (for most non-native speakers), so my point is gone. Good luck, they'll love to help you!",
                    "The National Museum in Nuuk is a professional museum and I doubt that they need volunteers, but the smaller museums in smaller towns may be desperate for (free) help!",
                    "Wild camping: same rules apply as in Iceland. Only a few towns actually have campsites - not including Nuuk. Ilulissat's campsite is recommended though, having a perfect location next to the ice fjord where wild camping is not allowed.",
                    "I know what you mean by slow travel. I think, when you exclude the cruise ships and Iceland-based daytrippers, the majority of tourists could be regarded as slow travellers. If not for their personal preferences, it is because of the lack of infrastructure, which pretty much forces people to stay in small places for several days and, when getting bored, therefore forces them to spot the undersides of leaves ;-)"

P√• det tidspunk er geviret stadig helt friskt og stinker helt forf√¶rdeligt, hun f√•r at vide at det skal ligge udend√∏rs og t√∏rre indtil det ikke lugter l√¶ngere. Nu har tupilaken s√• ligget de sidste 2 √•r p√• min altan og er blevet helt t√∏r og lugtfri - men den er ogs√• meget misfarvet, med gule og sorte pletter over det hele. S√• mit sp√∏rgsm√•l er om man kan afblege den eller om det bare er s√•dan den er eftersom den er sk√•ret i ren og ikke noget hval tand ?"

                    "What is killing is when tourists arrive with views like \"Look at this nation, living in harmony with nature, unspoiled, etc etc\". Or asking too much about independence (which is quite a silent, unthrilling debate, not a fight in any sense). Also killing: expecting traces of Norse culture, a vivid remembrance of the Second World War, igloos, a hunting culture (which is certainly there part-time, but fishing is the mainstay).",

Last year I believe three companies gave back their mining rights, before they even started to mine. Basically Greenlandic economy is 50 % fishery and 50 % subsidies (roughly). Simply put, the politicians saying Greenland can take care of them selves now, are full of shit. However, with the right approach, Greenland should be able to become independent (to whatever extent they so desire) within maybe 20-50 years.",

                    "Hi All üôÇ I‚Äôm a US based Harry Potter Collector and I am curious about how well the Greenlandic Philosophers Stone translation (Harry Potter Ujarallu Inuunartoq) was received and how popular the book and series were in Greenland when the book was released in 2002 and if there‚Äôs still any interest in the Potter series now. I‚Äôm also trying to figure out how many of the books were printed‚ÄîI know the book is considered rare even in Greenland. I‚Äôd ask the publisher, but I know they went out of business in 2009. For any who answer, I greatly appreciate your time üôÇ",
                    "I bought it when I was young and just started to grasp reading, I know some people at my age did aswell. But growing up, you realise more and more how easier it is to read danish. It is pretty common for those who likes litteracy to switch over to danish or english, there is also much wider variarity.",
                    "I sold mine for 200 USD + postage and already got an request from the same guy, who would cover the purchace + postage and another 200 USD.",
                    "Thank you for your reply üôÇ. I had a feeling that the Potter books may have been easier understood in Danish or English than Greenlandic. Also the full series was made available in Danish and of course in English.",
                    "I am working on a project (the book that lives) for my website alltheprettybooks.net where I am having speakers from all the languages that Potter was translated into read the title of the book, 1st chapter title and the first paragraph and then it‚Äôs posted to my website. If you are interested in being a reader or know someone who would be, please let me know. I have the material so I can provide that.",

But now I ordered the Etymology Eskimo Dictionary by Fortescue (I really love etymologies) and want to use its arrival as a new incentive to resume learning Greenlandic. ;) I mostly learned it by grammars. I had to learn Danish first and I have a tiny German book for Greenlandic that helped a lot with vocabulary, basic words etc. and to know what grammar parts there even are to learn, and with the grammar books, I could dive deeper into it to be able to explain it. The older learning books like Qaagit are only avilable in a used condition and are more expensive now, so I cannot afford it. But as a linguist I know my way around with grammars, that should do it so far. In my master's degree I want to go to Greenland for half a year working at the Oqaasileriffik as an internship. Before that I really have to hurry up with learning proper Greenlandic. ;)",
